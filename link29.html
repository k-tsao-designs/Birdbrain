		<h1>Darter</h1>
		<p>
			Slender and large, darters look rather like a cross between herons and cormorants.The slim head, sinuous neck, and wings are heron-like, while the plumage patterns, feather structure, rump, and feet more closely resemble those of the cormorant.
		</p>
		<p>
			Darters are entirely freshwater birds that occur in quiet waters in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate parts of America, Africa, Madagascar, Asia, and Australasia. They only incidentally come into conflict with humans, although some get caught in nets set for fish. They readily colonize artificial lakes, and increased in numbers in New Guinea following the introduction of the African tilapia fish to the southern lowlands. In Southeast Asia, people use darters for fishing, as they do, in a more organized way, with cormorants.
		</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The long, thin, straight bill has finely-toothed cutting edges, and is often used to spear fish. It does not have a terminal hook (unlike the shags and cormorants), but a hinge allows the upper mandible to move upward, thereby increasing the size of the gape. The head is small and flattened, and the neck thin and G-shaped. To reduce buoyancy, the body plumage is permeable to water, as it is also in shags and cormorants. The legs are short and stout with long toes, all four are webbed, as in most other pelecaniforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Plumage patterns vary between species, sexes, ages, and individuals; all are dark above, with dark tails. Long, slender scapular and mantle covert feathers have silver, white, gray, or light brown streaks, more marked in adults than in immature birds. Males are blacker than females, and immatures paler than adults, mainly on the head, neck, and underparts. As in ducks and rails, all the flight feathers of the wings are shed at the same time, and darters are then temporarily flightless. The long tail has corrugated outer feathers, which are shed gradually. Although their short legs are set well back, darters are agile among branches, which they grasp with prehensile feet to climb adroitly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Darters are adapted for soaring on thermal updrafts. Because of their long tails, they resemble flying crosses when gliding. Long-distance flights are usually made by spiraling up on a thermal updraft and then gliding down to the next one. Sometimes they climb trees and bushes before take-off. When they take off from water, both feet kick together, as in other pelecaniforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Darters are adapted for moving slowly underwater, submerging gradually and often swimming with only their head and neck exposed, like a swimming snake (hence their popular name of “snakebird”). They stalk their prey underwater, often moving very slowly with the neck coiled and the wings and tail spread. Between the seventh and ninth neck vertebrae there is a special hinge mechanism that enables the birds to dart their neck forward to snap up insects at the water surface or to stab fish, with the bill slightly open. A stabbed fish is usually shaken loose, flipped into the air, and swallowed head first. The same darting and stabbing mechanism is used in defense, to stab at the eyes of predators and unwary human molesters.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Darters are territorial and may defend not only small resting and nesting sites but substantial feeding, resting, and nesting areas, mainly by threat and display. They do, however, mix with other water birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and spoonbills, at roosts and nesting colonies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Breeding starts with a male selecting a nest-site and claiming a territory around it, which may include a whole tree. He decorates the site with a few fresh, green, leafy twigs, and displays to attract a mate and ward off other darters. There are strong similarities between darter and cormorant displays, which both include wing-waving in which the partly-closed wings are alternately raised, and twig-grasping, in which a nearby twig or stick is grabbed and shaken vigorously; indeed, darters differ more from cormorants physically than in their behavior. After pair-formation, the female builds the nest, often using an old one as a base, with material brought mainly by the male. Over the birds' range as a whole, breeding may occur at any time of year, and the entire cycle takes only three months.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first egg is laid 2–3 days after the start of a nest, and subsequent eggs at intervals of 1–3 days. Incubation (averaging 28 days) starts with the first egg. The eggs hatch at intervals of 1–4 days. The parents take turns in guarding the nest, from the start of building until the chicks are at least 1 week old. As long as the chicks are at the nest they are guarded, even during the night. Relief takes place at least three times a day, usually at dawn, noon, and dusk. At the nest-site the parents greet each other with several recognition displays before departure and arrival. Some of these displays are similar to those of other pelecaniforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Small chicks are fed six to nine times a day on partly digested fish, which flows down the inside of the upper bill. Larger chicks take food directly from the parent's throat, about twice a day at first but only once a day by about 5 weeks of age.
		</p>
		<p>
			The darter's body-care behavior – preening, shaking, stretching, scratching – resembles that of cormorants. As in their case, it includes spreadeagling the wings to dry, for darters are even less well waterproofed than cormorants.
