		<h1>Barbet</h1>
		<p>
			Most barbets have bristles around the gape and chin and bristles (or tufts of them) over the nostrils; in some Asian barbets the bristles are so long that they extend beyond the bill. The bearded appearance that this characteristic lends them gave rise to the common name for the family. Certain African and Asian species go by such descriptive names as “tinkerbird” and “coppersmith,” from the harsh, metallic tone of their repetitive calls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barbets are so closely related to toucans that some taxonomists treat the various barbet groups and toucans as subfamilies of a single family (or alternatively group the American barbets with toucans in the toucan family). However, the fact remains that toucans differ in many ways from barbets, while barbets are generally similar to one another in build and behavior. Thus, since no one could mistake a toucan for a barbet, and because there are no intermediate forms, barbets are treated here as a distinct family.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Barbets are compact, thickset birds with rather large heads and bills that are stout, conical, and sharply tipped. In larger species, the bill may be especially formidable; Tricholaema and Lybius species have notched bills that help them grip food, and in the Toucan-barbet and Prong-billed barbet the tip of the upper mandible fits into a deep cleft in the tip of the lower mandible. The tongue is brush-tipped, which helps them eat fruits, their juices, and nectar. Their legs are short and strong, the feet zygodactylic (on each foot, the second and third toes point forward, while the first and fourth point backward, as in their toucan and woodpecker relatives). The birds are more often found in the foliage than on the trunks of trees, and their short tail is used as a support in excavating nests. The large barbets appear heavy and cumbersome in their movements, but others (for example, the Red-headed barbet and the tinkerbirds) are agile, probing and gleaning much like tits. The wings are short and rounded, and unsuitable for sustained flight. Ground barbets move by inelegant hops.
		</p>
		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Any visitor to Africa is certain to hear the repetitive, often monotonous, calls of barbets, since they occur in all the continent's major vegetation zones; 7 African genera (41 species) are recognized, and within these there is a generally greater divergence in size, bill shape, and color pattern than is found in Asian and American genera. Adaptation to more arid habitats within Africa is thought to have given rise to the ground barbets and some others. In tropical Asia and America the barbets are on average larger, extremely vocal, and also mainly arboreal; 3 genera (15 species) are recognized in the Americas and 3 genera (26 species) in southern Asia (where 2 genera contain only one species each). There are some notable cases of convergence in barbets. For example, black, yellow-and-white, and brown-colored barbets occur in Africa and southern Asia; spotted barbets are found in Africa and America; and the Black-backed barbet of central Africa resembles the White-mantled barbet, which can be found in northwestern South America.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only a few Asian barbets in China and the Himalayas migrate; other barbets may move locally as rainfall and the food availability shift.
		</p>
		<h2>Courtship and Breeding</h2>
		<p>
			Because of the difficulty in observing barbets (many build very high nests), and the fact that they usually form long pair-bonds, their courtship behavior is incompletely known. The male may display aerially, and follow the female about. In social Lybius and Trachyphonus species the primary male and female duet together and prevent other members of the social group from duetting; removal of one of the primary pair virtually instantly results in it being replaced by another group member as a duetting partner of the remaining male or female of the pair. In ground barbets both sexes spread their head feathers, and the tail, the male strutting around the female; they duet together, the male cocking its tail, the female often with tail lowered as they sing and turn their heads about, alert to responses by neighbors. Duetting is a common feature of barbets on all three continents. It has soft, short-distance components, and louder, long-distance components for communication within the pair or group, and with rival, neighboring groups. Duets occur throughout the year (more frequently when breeding); playback of a part of the duet involves an immediate response by the resident group, and indeed may trigger increased duetting and group interactions for several days thereafter. It functions to maintain pair-bonds, to mediate within-group relations, and to maintain territories. Most barbets are highly territorial.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barbets are aggressive to other birds, especially of their species, but also to other hole-nesting species (such as woodpeckers and starlings), to honeyguides, and to fruit-eating competitors. Family parties usually roost communally, but in some Megalaima species the young are independent within several days and are forced out of the territory as their parents prepare to nest again.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dependence of barbets upon suitable trees for excavating cavities, and thus for forests and woodlands that are ever diminishing, may account for the status of one species – Capito hypoleucus – as Endangered and 9 others as near-threatened. These forests continue to be cleared and used for livestock farming, arable cultivation, oil extraction, and mining.
