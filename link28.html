		<h1>Curassow</h1>
		<p>
			his central and south american family comprises three groups, the chachalacas, guans, and curassows. They are big-bodied birds with smallish heads, thin necks, short, rounded wings, and long, broad tails. Unusually for game birds, they are chiefly tree-dwellers, although they generally descend to the ground to feed.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the cracids are noisy birds – necessarily so, to maintain contact in the dense and often dark forests where they live. The windpipes of some species, notably the guans, are adapted for amplifying calls that are among the loudest and most far-reaching found in any bird species. Curassows utter one or two booming or whistling notes.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Curassows are the largest and heaviest members of the family and are poor fliers, spending most of their time at ground level. They range in plumage from deep blue to black, invariably with a purple gloss, and the majority have rather curly crests. Their distinguishing features, especially in the genus Crax, are the head or facial adornments of wattles and knobs, which vary from yellow to bright crimson and blue in color. The Helmeted and Horned curassows have “horns” on the forehead that are used in elaborate courtship displays. The Razor-billed curassows have more reduced ornamentation, terminating in a sharp, razorlike ridge. The Nocturnal curassow, with its chestnut-colored plumage and red and blue facial skin, is one of the most colorful members of the whole family, yet is entirely nocturnal.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the Cracidae are mainly vegetarian, eating principally fruit but also leaves, buds, and flowers; some also take small animals, large insects, or frogs. The chachalacas and curassows, with their long legs, big feet, and strong claws, scratch the litter on the forest floor in chickenlike fashion. Curassows are able to eat nuts and tough seeds by swallowing small stones that aid digestion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nests are often built in a tree concealed by cover, and are usually fragile structures that are quite small in relation to the size of the adult bird. The eggs are rather large, and are smooth in some of the guans (genus Penelope), but rough and pitted in the chachalacas and most of the curassows. Females care for the young, which can leave the nest after only a few hours and are quick to develop their flight feathers. Indeed, the young of some species are able to fly within a few days.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Conservation: Easy Targets</h2>
		<p>
			Most cracid species are relentlessly hunted for food and “sport,” their tameness and inability to fly far or fast making them easy targets. Over large tracts of land, the rapid destruction of tropical rain forest is also threatening this little-known family of birds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The White-winged guan was thought to have become extinct in 1870, but was rediscovered in 1977. Estimates of its population do not exceed 200 birds, and most of those live in an area threatened with logging activity. The Red-billed curassow is also close to extinction; at one point it was down to less than 100 individuals, but a captive breeding and reintroduction program has proved successful in increasing the population to some degree. The most precarious of all cracids is the Alagoas curassow, which is extinct in the wild. Approximately 50 individuals exist in captivity, and it is hoped that their progeny may be reintroduced into the wild some day.
