		<h1>Finch</h1>
		<p>
			Celebrating the english spring, William Wordsworthwrote: “Thou, Linnet! In thy green array, Presiding spirit here today, Dost lead the revels of the May.” Like the poet, few people can be unfamiliar with finches – if not his Green linnet (better known today as the siskin), then maybe the goldfinch of North America, the canaries of Africa, or the rosefinches of Asia. With the exception of a few species, the Carduelidae are tree-dwelling forest birds, more so than their allies, the Fringillidae.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finches exhibit a range of beak sizes, each species adapted to foraging on the seeds of particular plant species, from thistledown for the goldfinch to the cherrystones favored by the hawfinch, whose beak can exert as much power as a man can with a pair of pliers. Many species frequently come to bird tables, taking advantage of the seeds put out for them. Certain species are also renowned for their song; early settlers took them far afield to remind them of home.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Together with the fringillid finches and the Hawaiian honeycreepers to which they are closely allied, the carduelids are distinguished by the presence of nine (not ten) primaries, 12 tail feathers, and certain skull features. They occur throughout Europe, Africa (though not, curiously, Madagascar), and Asia, and some groups have colonized the Americas, predominantly in the north; a group of 12 remarkably similar siskin species in Central and South America represent something of an outpost and may be derived from a single, windblown flock. Particular species have also been introduced, with varying degrees of success, in various parts of the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Relationships between the three finch families (Fringillidae, Carduelidae, and Drepanididae) and the other recently evolved passerine families, particularly the buntings (Emberizidae) and the tanagers (Thraupidae), have been the subject of much debate. At least part of the confusion stems from the recent origin of these groups and their relatively rapid speciation; consequently, differences between them tend to be much smaller than between the nonpasserine families. As a result, different authors treat groups as subfamilies within the same family or, alternatively, as separate families within a superfamily.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finches have a long history of association with humans. The Island canary, common in the wooded parts of the Azores, the Canary Islands, and Madeira, was first brought to Europe in the 16th century and was rapidly domesticated to become the ancestor of all the cage canaries. Although the plumage of the wild canary (a rather dull streaky green) differs between the sexes, those of cage birds seldom do. A wide range of forms have been carefully bred from chance mutations, differing widely in shape, color, and song (which is also more elaborate than in the birds' wild cousin). For example, the “Norwich” is a bulbous bird with rather fluffy feathers, whereas the “Yorkshire” is a much slimmer type with a sleek plumage. A number of other finches, particularly the goldfinches, have been popular as cage birds for both their bright plumage and delightful song; it is no coincidence that the name for a flock of these alluring birds is a “charm.” They are crossbred with canaries (producing hybrids, or “mules”) in the search for new color forms and better songsters.
		</p>
		<p>
			The birds have also been put to other uses. They are more sensitive than humans to carbon monoxide (which we cannot smell), and were used by miners and by tunneling soldiers in the First World War to warn of the buildup of this gas. Canaries were particularly popular because their bright yellow plumage made them easy to see in the gloom. More recently, canaries' singing behavior has been studied with a view to improving the treatment of neurological disorders. The birds sing only in the spring and summer, and the part of the midbrain (the song control nucleus) that controls the voicebox or syrinx is much larger in males, particularly those with extended song repertoires, than in females. It is also larger in spring than in winter, and this seasonal change in size is caused both by the growth of individual cells and by the largescale birth and death of neurons, something that had previously not been thought to occur. If this process can be understood, it may be possible to apply the knowledge in the treatment of neurological wasting diseases, such as Alzheimer's.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some species are pests of various crops. In Britain, the bullfinch has been a major pest of orchards, taking the flowerbuds of many fruit trees, particularly those of pears and plums. In earlier times the bird had a price on its head – in the 16th century, a penny per bird. In the 1960s and 1970s the problem was particularly acute, as an increasing population expanded out of the birds' traditional woodland habitats. Following a precipitous decline in numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s, however, damage is much less of a problem, and the species is now even seen as a target for conservation measures. In America the House finch is also a major pest of fruit crops, particularly in California, and in Africa some species can become locally abundant in particular areas and do serious damage to crops.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			The cardueline finches feed almost entirely on seeds; some species, such as the linnet, even raise their young entirely on seeds. The largely northern Carduelis species tend to be fairly agile and have relatively fine bills for picking seeds out of seedpods and plant heads (typically from the family Asteraceae, for example thistles and dandelions). The canaries and seedeaters of the other large genus, Serinus, mostly dwell in the relatively arid landscapes of Africa and have heavier bills, more often feeding on the ground on shed seeds. The remaining species are a fairly diverse group including the hawfinch, which can crack open cherrystones with its massive bill, the crossbills, which are uniquely adapted to feeding on seeds in pine cones, and the rosefinches, which inhabit the mountain ranges of Asia.
		</p>
		<p>
			The carduelines' seed-dominated diet contrasts with that of the fringillid finches, which are much more catholic, taking a range of invertebrates in addition to seeds. Consequently, they show some differences in skull structure and the associated musculature, and have much more specialized feeding habits and adaptations (see The Beak of the Finch). They also tend to be less territorial; most species, with the notable exception of the bullfinches, nest in loose colonies and forage in flocks, even during the breeding season.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many species migrate to separate wintering quarters. Those in Europe and North America often migrate south during the winter as seeds become unavailable, although the extent to which this occurs varies between species and even between populations of the same species. The rosefinches of central Asia, which may be found at altitudes of 4,000-5,000m (13,000–16,500ft) during the breeding season, typically move to lower elevations during the winter, although some species are remarkably hardy and remain at higher altitudes. The African seedeaters, on the other hand, tend to be either mostly sedentary or else rove in nomadic flocks searching for seed-rich areas. The northern tree-feeding species – siskins, redpolls, grosbeaks, and crossbills – also tend to be nomadic, following a fluctuating food supply.
		</p>
		<p>
			In years when the seed crops fail, particularly following periods when the crop has been good, birds may irrupt, moving out of their normal ranges in enormous numbers in search of food. As long ago as 1251, the chronicler Matthew Paris wrote about strange birds (crossbills) that had invaded England in great numbers and devastated the apple crop (there being few conifers to feed on). Such irruptions occur throughout the birds' range, but are best documented in Europe, where they occur at irregular intervals up to 17 years apart. Reports of irruptive crossbills ringed in Switzerland have come from as far afield as Spain later in the same winter (the birds having continued in their search for food), or, in subsequent years, from birds breeding in Siberia, 4,000km (2,500 miles) to the northeast.
		</p>
		<h2>The Beak of the Finch</h2>
		<p>
			The beak of a finch is modified internally for husking seeds. Each seed is wedged in a groove on the side of the palate and crushed by raising the lower jaw. The husk is peeled off with the aid of the tongue and then discarded, while the kernel is swallowed. The more specialized cardueline finches have developed musculature that allows much more lateral movement of the bill, making the husking process more efficient.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ancestral finches probably had general-purpose bills similar to that found in the chaffinch today. From this basic shape a number of modifications have evolved. Goldfinches and siskins have long, tweezerlike bills for probing into seedheads and small cones. The goldfinch is the only species able to eat the seeds of teasel, which lie at the bottom of long, spiked tubes. They are also very agile, enabling them to take seeds remaining on the plant. Siskins also have tweezerlike bills and feed largely from seeds in small cones, such as alder. The African canaries and Asian rosefinches have stouter bills and take a much wider range of seeds and berries; they are also less agile, and generally feed on the ground or in bushes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bullfinches and grosbeaks have rounded bills with sharp edges and feed largely on buds and berries. As their name suggests, the crossbills have unique crossed bills, which enable them to prize the scales off cones to get at the seeds hidden underneath. In Europe there are four species, each with a different-sized bill, and each feeding primarily on a different type of cone. The Two-barred crossbill has the slenderest bill and feeds on soft larch cones; the medium-billed Red and Scottish crossbills differ slightly in their bill shape, with the former feeding on spruce cones and the latter on those of Scotch pine; the large, heavy-billed Parrot crossbill also feeds on pinecones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among the finches, the hawfinch has the largest bill, enabling it to crack open very hard-shelled seeds. To deal with these, the hawfinch has two finely serrated knobs on either side of the midline on both the upper and lower mandibles. These spread the strain of cracking hard seeds evenly over all muscles. With these tools hawfinches, which weigh just 55g (2oz), can generate the loads of up to 45kg (100lb) required to crush olive stones.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Unlike the chaffinch or brambling, in which the male first establishes a territory and then attracts a mate, carduelines will pair up first, then find a nest site and establish a small territory round it. Pair-formation may take some time, with a male bird repeatedly approaching a female, often in a crouching posture, dropping or raising his wings and/or spreading his tail feathers, depending on the species. Many species also make display flights – some, such as the American goldfinch and linnet, fly over the nest, others, like the redpoll, ranging more widely. In the Carduelis and Serinus species, the display is often rather slow and butterflylike, but in the trumpeter finches and Crimson-winged finch the bird circles high with an undulating flight, alternating fluttering ascents with gliding descents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because they eat a wide variety of seeds, many finches have extended breeding seasons, and individual pairs may raise two or three broods (unlike the fringillids, which feed their young mainly on caterpillars and are single- or double-brooded). The goldfinches of both Europe and North America prefer to feed on thistles and breed later in the season, the American goldfinch being one of the latest nesters on that continent. The crossbills, however, may nest in any month; depending largely on the erratic cone crops of conifers, this may be during the spring in pine forests, in late summer in larch forests, or even in winter in spruce forests, while if a mix of trees is available, breeding may occur almost continuously. Breeding in winter has been recorded near Moscow in air temperatures of –19°C (–2.2°F); the incubating female maintained the nest at a cosy 38°C (100.4°F). Many of the African species have similarly extended breeding seasons, again to exploit seed crops that arise after the rainy periods.
		</p>
		<p>
			The nest is usually a cup made of mosses, grass, animal hair, or feathers, and is typically built by the female, although male bullfinches and grosbeaks help in the early stages. In general, the female alone is responsible for incubating the eggs and brooding the young, for a period of around 3–4 weeks. During this time the male, who also feeds the young when they hatch, feeds her. As the hatchlings get older, the female will join in feeding them. Parents will often forage some distance from the nest in search of suitable seeds or insects for their young, returning at infrequent intervals (perhaps every 20–60 minutes). Although most finches carry food back to nestlings in their gullet, the grosbeaks, trumpeter finches, and bullfinches develop special sacs in the floor of their mouths, on either side of the tongue, to hold food. These, when full, extend back as far as the neck, giving a noticeably bulging throat. They seem to be formed anew each spring. Although some of the larger species can live in excess of 15 years, most birds probably only live for 2–3 years.
