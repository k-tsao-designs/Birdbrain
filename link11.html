		<h1>Bee Eaters</h1>
		<p>
			Thoroughly attractive, sleek, graceful, melodious, restrainedly colorful, and sociable, bee-eaters really are rather special birds. Wherever they occur, throughout the Mediterranean, Africa, Madagascar, South and Southeast Asia, and Australia, they are regarded with great affection (except by bee-keepers, since bee-eaters certainly can make serious inroads into beehive populations).
		</p>
		<p>
			The European bee-eater, better named the Golden bee-eater, is on every young birdwatcher's “must-see” list. In Australia the arrival of their only species, the Rainbow bee-eater or Rainbowbird, is taken to herald the spring. Throughout Africa, villagers take a proprietary pride in any nearby colony of Carmine bee-eaters, while a clamorous nesting colony of 50,000 Rosy bee-eaters is one of the seven wonders of the bird world.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Bee-eaters are highly colored birds: most are green above and green, buff, or chestnut below, but one is predominantly black, one blue, one pink and gray, and one carmine. All have a black eye mask, most have a black band on the upper breast, and the intervening chin and throat are strikingly bright yellow, red, reddish, blue, or snowy, often with a cheek stripe of contrasting color. Wings are rounded (in forest-dwelling bee-eaters) or long and pointed (in open-country species, particularly those that hunt or migrate over long distances). In most species the wings are green with a broad black trailing edge. The tail is quite long, not much patterned, but often with slightly or greatly elongated central feathers or, in the Swallow-tailed bee-eater, elongated outer feathers. In other respects, all species are physically much alike: large-headed, short-necked birds with a long, slender, downcurved bill, very short legs, and weak feet. When perched, all move the tail backwards and forwards through a small arc – these are balancing movements which have come to have a social function. All sunbathe using a number of postures, the commonest being to sit back-to-the-sun with mantle feathers acutely raised.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of differences between the species in overall size, wing shape, tail shape, and the shape of individual feathers in the forehead, chin, and throat, bee-eaters were formerly classified in up to eight genera. Certainly two large Indian and Malaysian species, the Red-bearded and Blue-bearded bee-eaters, are sufficiently distinctive to be separated into their own genus (Nyctyornis). They are large, quite heavy, relatively sluggish birds with robust, gray-based bills, with the curved top ridged and grooved; they have long, pendent throat feathers and long, square-ended tails that are yellow below. They are not very vocal, and their calls are somewhat coarse. The Red-bearded bee-eater is a bright grass-green bird with an amazing combination of colors around the head: lilac-pink, scarlet, and a little blue, set off with an orange-yellow eye. In forests on the island of Sulawesi lives the Purple-bearded bee-eater, green, russet, dark maroon, and blue, which is more slimly built but shares the same character of a full throat with long, pendent feathers. It possesses six ribs, as opposed to five in the Red-bearded and Blue-bearded bee-eaters, and so is placed in its own genus (Meropogon).
		</p>

		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			The bee-eater family is essentially tropical, and its more primitive members, the Blue-bearded, Red-bearded, and Purple-bearded bee-eaters, inhabit south and southeast Asian rain forests: this and other clues suggest that bee-eaters arose there, and spread over to the African continent, where they proliferated. Ancestral populations of these birds evolved separately as a result of having been isolated in rain forest between northern and southern tropical savannas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Northern and southern Carmine bee-eaters are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor only about 13,000 years ago, and the northern tropical Red-throated bee-eater and southern tropical White-fronted bee-eater diverged from their common ancestor about 75,000 years ago. Only two species of bee-eater penetrate the temperate zone of Europe and Asia to any distance. No species has ever invaded the New World, and only the ancestral Rainbow bee-eater has ever entered Australia.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			The world distribution of the family was remarkably congruent with the world distribution of honeybees, genus Apis, before the spread of bee-keeping to the temperate zone and the Americas. That is for the simple reason that by far the commonest prey of most bee-eaters are honeybees. When readily available – near their hives, or around flowering trees and herbs – they are taken in preference to other, equally abundant flying insects. All four species of honeybee are hunted and eaten, including the Giant honeybee (Apis dorsata), a dangerous stinger living in vast colonies that Oriental people regard with great respect. Other insects taken by some species of bee-eaters include bumblebees, wasps, hornets, dragonflies, and damselflies. The great majority of bees caught are venomous workers; the few non-stinging drones (male bees) taken probably reflect their scarcity outside of the hive. A European bee-eater requires about 225 bee-sized insects to sustain it and its young every day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bee-eaters hunt mainly by keeping watch for flying insects from a perch. They sit alertly on a vantage point such as a treetop twig, fence, or telegraph wire, turning the head to scan on all sides, then fly out quickly to intercept a passing insect. The prey is seized adroitly in the bill, taken after a short twisting and turning pursuit; in a graceful glide the bird then returns to its perch, where it tosses the prey to grip it in the tip of the bill, and strikes it several times against the perch to left and right. A stinging insect is then held near the tip of its tail, which is rubbed against the perch with the motion of someone using an eraser. A bee's bowel fluid is squeezed out, wetting the perch, and its sting and poison sacs are torn away. Several beating and rubbing bouts alternate, after which the immobilized insect is swallowed entire.
		</p>
		<p>
			In open country the larger, pointed-winged bee-eaters – namely the Blue-cheeked, Olive, Blue-tailed, European, Rosy, Carmine, Blue-throated and Rainbow bee-eaters – forage by “flycatching” from a treetop or pylon cable; to varying extents they also hunt in easy, wheeling flight on high, catching insect after insect without coming to perch in between times. Blue-tailed bee-eaters in Malaysia were watched foraging over a huge paddyfield divided into quadrants with overhead wires, which made accurate measuring of distances easy. They perched facing into the breeze and, sighting a hornet no less than 80–95m (90–100yds) away, they flew out fast, straight, and level or slightly rising on a course to pass immediately below the insect. At the last instant they reached up with the bill to seize the victim from below with deft precision.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Africa, Carmine bee-eaters commonly hunt high in the sky. Some, netted for study immediately they had alighted to rest on bushes, had bills that were sticky with characteristically-smelling honeybee venom, so it seems that they may catch bees on high, de-venom them by nibbling them in the mandibles, and then eat them without having to come to a perch to deal with them in the usual manner. Also in Africa, the beautiful White-throated bee-eater of the southern borders of the Sahara is the exception to the rule that only the large, long-winged species hunt in flight. These are small birds, quite round-winged, and they feed largely on flying ants caught high in the air. From the Sahara they migrate to winter over equatorial forests, and there they feed above the canopy, by “flycatching” from treetops and in continuous flight. A trick of theirs is to perch on the lower fronds of an oil palm, in the head of which a squirrel is systematically stripping the outer, oily fibers away to get at the kernel. The birds sally out to snatch the falling strips in midair, return to perch, and eat them just as if the strips were beetles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Carmine bee-eaters have other feeding specializations as well. They prey largely on locusts and follow migratory swarms of the insects. They come from afar to bushfires to exploit insects put to flight by the flames, mainly locusts, grasshoppers, and mantises, catching them by wheeling around at the very edge of the flames and smoke. Carmine bee-eaters also quite often follow people and vehicles moving through the African bush, catching insects disturbed from the grass. Similarly, they also use grazing and galloping antelopes, but have gone one further evolutionary step and actually ride upon them, using them as “animate perches.” The habit is commonplace in the northern tropics, where these flamboyant birds may be seen on the backs of bustards, storks, goats, or antelopes anywhere from Senegal to Somalia. For some reason, however, the habit is not common south of the equator. Quite unexpectedly, Carmine bee-eaters, along with two or three other species in Africa and the Orient, have occasionally caught fish; they fly slowly low over the still surface of a pond or river, then make a shallow dive straight into the top few centimeters of the water, and immediately rise into the air again with a small fish in their beak. So bee-eaters will eat fish just as their distant relatives the kingfishers will sometimes eat bees.
