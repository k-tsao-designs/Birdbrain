		<h1>Falcon</h1>
		<p>
			For most people, the familiar image of a falcon is likely to be that of a Common or American kestrel hovering over a road verge, or a Peregrine falcon being used in falconry. Each is a true falcon of the genus Falco, a long-winged resident of open spaces. The Falconidae, to which the birds belong, is the second-largest grouping of diurnal birds of prey, quite distinct from the hawks and eagles grouped in the Accipitridae. The family is usually separated into two subfamilies, the Falconinae (true falcons and falconets) and the Polyborinae (caracaras and forest-falcons).
		</p>
		<p>
			Falconidae species differ most obviously from the Accipitridae in not constructing nests, in the molt sequence of the primary wing feathers (starting in their case with the fourth-outermost feather), and also in details of bodily structure that include a reinforcement of the thorax, a short neck, and a special syrinx. Both families have fossil remains from the Eocene at least 35 million years ago, but each has developed along quite different lines, and falcons have in many respects converged more to resemble owls than their closer relatives, the hawks, buzzards, and eagles. The Falconidae probably originated on the continents of the southern hemisphere, with South America, separated from the north until only 3 million years ago, alone preserving something of their original diversity; up to ten genera are still found there, seven of them endemic.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The true falcons do not build nests. They probably originated from the smaller falconets, which breed inside the abandoned nests of other birds and lay white eggs, uniquely within the Falconidae but typically for hole-nesters. The Spot-winged falconet of South America breeds inside the bulky nests of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) or the Monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), and is so caracaralike in aspects of its anatomy that it is sometimes included among the Polyborinae. The African Pygmy falcon, which nests within the bulky nests of the White-headed buffalo-weaver (Dinemellia dinemelli) or the Sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), shows differences in coloration between sexes that presage those found in several kestrel species. In Asia, the White-rumped falcon, the other pygmy species, nests in old holes excavated in trees by woodpeckers or barbets, as do the five species of Microhierax falconets.
		</p>
		<p>
			For food, the pygmy-falcons generally specialize on insects, lizards, and small birds, which may either be snatched from the ground or else from the trunks and branches of saplings. The tiny Asian falconets, such as the Philippine falconet, chase large flying insects above the forest canopy or else snatch small birds or lizards with the aid of their strong feet. Asian falconets are characterized by both sexes having a pied plumage, with black feet and cere. Most are found in small groups, in which the members often perch close together, even sharing one another's prey. In at least one species, the Collared falconet, all members also deliver food to a single nest, a form of cooperative breeding that, in the raptors, is apparently only shared with the Red-faced caracara. All the pygmy falcons and falconets pump their tails up and down in excitement and display, as do several smaller kestrels, including the American kestrel.
		</p>
		<p>
			The true falcons apparently underwent a worldwide radiation within the last few million years, and so are relatively uniform in behavior, calls, and design, including the dark mustache stripe they all share. The smallest of them are the kestrels, most of which (10 species) occur in Africa and its islands. The Seychelles, Mauritius, and Madagascar kestrels are barely larger than falconets, and share their tail-pumping behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			In their African winter quarters, these falcons, joined by thousands of Lesser kestrels from Europe, return year after year to the same roosts, the largest of which may hold up to 100,000 birds. The roosts are often in stands of large exotic trees associated with villages or other human habitation, from which the birds spread out and exploit local flushes of such food as termites, crickets, solifugids (sun spiders), and locusts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The larger true falcons are stocky birds of exceptionally swift flight, with long, pointed wings powered by bulky breast muscles and relatively short tails. They habitually kill their prey, principally birds, in full flight, either striking them dead with a blow from the foot or else dragging them to the ground in their talons and executing them with the notched, powerful bill. Best known is the Peregrine falcon, capable of feats of speed and precision flying unequaled by any other bird; its maximum speed, achieved in a bulletlike dive from great height, reaches 180km/h (112mph), or maybe more. Whatever the exact figure, a peregrine in full stoop is a most impressive sight, and the bird has traditionally been the first choice of kings, sheikhs, and commoners too as a hunting bird for the ancient art of falconry.
		</p>
		<p>
			The peregrine is the most cosmopolitan of all the birds of prey, and its distribution overlaps that of many other falcon species. In South America peregrines coexist with the large Orange-breasted, the medium-sized Aplomado, and the small Bat falcons, all of which are black and orange in color; in Africa they share their range with the rufous-breasted Barbary and Taita falcons. Peregrines also overlap with a group of large, pale-colored falcons, known as “desert falcons,” since they inhabit open habitats and hunt as much on the ground as in the air. These include the gyrfalcon, the largest of all Falconidae species. This bird, which is adapted to the High Arctic tundra of North America and Eurasia, feeds primarily on ptarmigans and ground squirrels, and occurs in white, gray, and brown color phases that each predominate in different areas. Other desert falcons include the Prairie falcon of North America, the Lanner falcon of Africa, the Saker falcon of the Middle East and the central Asian steppes, and the Laggar falcon of India.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The breeding habits of true falcons are fairly uniform. They start with aerial and perched displays, often centered on the nest-site. The male enters with wings aloft, showing off the underwing colors, and then bows and calls once he has landed. The nests are most often placed in a scrape on a cliff ledge, in an old stick nest appropriated from some other bird such as a crow or a stork, or in a tree cavity, although buildings, nest boxes, utility pylons, and other structures are also now used. Most species breed as widely- spaced territorial pairs, but a few also nest in small colonies, notably Lesser kestrels on old buildings, both species of red-footed falcons in abandoned rook (Corvus frugilegus) colonies, and Eleanora's falcon on the cliffs of offshore islands. Successive pairs of peregrines and gyrfalcons have been known to use particular nest-sites for periods of over 100 years. Among 49 British peregrine cliffs known to falconers between the 16th and 19th centuries, at least 42 were still in use up to the outbreak of the Second World War.
		</p>
		<p>
			The handsome, rufous eggs of true falcons are laid directly on the nest floor; held up to the light, the shells appear buff-colored, rather than the pale green of those of Accipitridae species. Incubation is mainly undertaken by the female, while the male hunts for and supplies food, although in smaller species the male may remain on the nest while the female goes off feeding. Any surplus food that the female does not require immediately may be cached, and consumed later in the day.
		</p>
		<p>
			The eggs are laid at 2–3 day intervals, but incubation only begins towards the end of the clutch, so that the chicks of a brood are of similar age and size. The female later joins the male in bringing food to the chicks. In species that take relatively large and agile prey, especially other birds, the pair may hunt cooperatively, the smaller and more maneuverable male combining with the larger, more powerful female in attacks on quarry; both share the kill when the hunt is successful. Juveniles are usually only supported in the parental territory for 1–2 months after fledging, after which they may wander considerable distances before molting into adult plumage at the end of their first year and then settling down to breed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the Polyborinae, caracaras – uniquely among falcons – build their own nests, which take the form of shallow constructions of small sticks; the Striated caracara occasionally breeds in loose colonies. As for the forest-falcons, their breeding habits have proved so difficult to study that the first nest of any of the six species, that of a Collared forest-falcon, was only discovered in 1978. It was located in a natural hole in a tree.
		</p>

		<h2>The effects of pesticides on birds of prey</h2>
		<p>
			Toxic chemicals that kill living organisms (biocides), particularly fungal, plant, and animal pests of humans (pesticides), have been widely used since their development in the 1950s. Of these, the cheap and efficient organochlorines have the most harmful effects on wildlife populations, especially predatory birds. Besides being acutely toxic, these chemicals have three further dangerous properties. First, they are stable, and so persist in the environment for many years. Second, they are soluble and accumulate in the body fat of animals, and so pass from prey to predator. Their concentrations therefore increase in successive steps up a food chain, so that raptors, at the top, are especially likely to accumulate large amounts. Third, even small doses may disrupt breeding and reduce the number of young produced.
		</p>
		<p>
			All bird species that have been studied have been found to be susceptible to organochlorines, but the most marked population declines have occurred in bird-feeding raptors, most notably in the Peregrine falcon in the eastern USA and western Europe but also in the accipiters of these areas, the Sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks and the Eurasian sparrowhawk respectively. Some fish-eating species also declined, including the osprey and Bald eagle in North America and the White-tailed eagle in northern Europe.
		</p>
		<p>
			DDT, the most widely-used organochlorine, is in fact not particularly toxic to birds when consumed directly, but its principal breakdown product, DDE, dramatically alters the structure of eggshells, thereby affecting the survival of embryos. Affected shells become thinner and often break during incubation, or they may interfere with the gaseous exchange between the embryo and the air. Both effects, in combination with direct poisoning of the embryos, may lower hatching success to a point where the number of young produced does not offset adult mortality, and the population consequently declines or even becomes extinct.
		</p>
		<p>
			Different groups of birds vary in their sensitivity to DDE. Birds of prey are particularly vulnerable, partly because they accumulate more DDE than other birds, but also because a given level of DDE produces a greater degree of shell-thinning. The eggshells of herons and pelicans also appear relatively sensitive to DDE, but game-birds and songbirds, frequently prey species, are relatively secure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to their persistence, organochlorines often become dispersed over wide areas, in the bodies of migrant animals or in currents of air and water, and so may affect populations remote from their areas of usage. Hence, even birds of prey that breed in areas where pesticides are not used will not necessarily escape contamination. In winter they may migrate to areas where pesticides are used; for example, Peregrine falcons that nest in the High Arctic migrate south to Latin America, and may become contaminated by DDT in their winter quarters.
		</p>
		<p>
			In areas where organochlorine use has been curtailed, most bird species have recovered their numbers and range, as with Peregrine falcons in the USA or the endemic Mauritius kestrels. However, DDT residues in the soil are so persistent that they may remain a problem for decades to come, particularly since no bird species has developed any resistance to them, unlike many of their insect targets. In Europe and North America, the use of organochlorines reached a peak in the 1960s, but was banned in subsequent years. However, their use in developing countries remains high, and the raptors there, such as Lanner falcons in South Africa, African fish-eagles, or vultures in India, are showing signs of contamination or decline. Alternative pesticides with less severe environmental effects are now available, but most are more expensive than the original organochlorines.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the meantime, many other industrial pollutants have emerged that also affect wildlife. Organophosphates, used to kill seed-eating birds in Africa, often kill raptors incidentally; polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, are widespread in developed nations; and heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, kill raptors when prey carry high levels in their blood. Careful use of chemicals that can enter the environment remains essential to the birds' longterm survival.
