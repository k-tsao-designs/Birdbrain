		<h1>Australian Warbler</h1>
		<p>
			The australian warblers of the family Acanthizidae (or Pardalotidae) are also sometimes referred to as the pardalotids, the lack of a commonly agreed name reflecting the diversity of form, habitat, and behavior of the 67 living species. Usually subdued in color, they are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from the tiny weebill, weighing just 5g (0.2oz), to the Rufous bristlebird at 80g (3oz).
		</p>
		<p>
			Australian warblers are common in habitats ranging from tropical rain forest to desert, from coast to alps, and from ground to canopy. The family is notable for the variety of its social organization and vocalizations; cooperative breeding is common, and many species have mellifluous or striking songs, sometimes including mimicry or duetting.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Morphological variation reflects foraging methods and diet, leading to convergence in form with ecologically similar birds. Most species have straight, slender bills, suitable for a diet dominated by insects and other small arthropods. Those gleaning insects in the canopy are small, warblerlike birds, while species feeding primarily on the ground tend to be larger, and look similar to wrens or thrushes. In contrast, the brightly-colored pardalotes are reminiscent of flowerpeckers and have short, stubby bills, which they use to pick tiny insects and their sugary exudates off the surface of eucalypt leaves. Weebills have similar bills, probably for a similar function. Whitefaces have strong, titlike bills, reflecting the importance of seeds in their diet. The resemblance of various Acanthizidae to warblers, wrens, thrushes, tits, and flowerpeckers confused early taxonomists, but is now known to be the result of evolutionary convergence, not ancestry.
		</p>
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Australian warblers typically have a long breeding cycle. Most nest in all-purpose territories, although Forty-spotted pardalotes form loose colonies. Eggs are laid at two-day intervals, even in tiny species, and the clutch is usually two or three, although some species can lay four eggs. Incubation periods are long for the size of the birds; the White-browed scrubwren, for example, which weighs just 13g (0.5oz), incubates for 17–21 days. Nestling periods are more typical of birds of their size, but the young are usually looked after for six to eight weeks after leaving the nest, and never for less than three weeks. Many species are multibrooded and have breeding seasons of three to five months or more. Individuals of even tiny species can be long-lived; for example, a Brown thornbill weighing just 7g (0.25oz) was recaptured in the wild 17 years after marking!
		</p>
		<p>
			Australian warblers build covered nests with a side entrance, which vary among species in ingenious ways. Nests built on or near the ground can be notoriously well-hidden. White-browed scrubwrens can build nests in hollows under leaf litter, and Speckled warblers make a scrape in the ground so that the base of the nest is below ground level. Pardalotes build their nests in tree hollows or in chambers at the end of tunnels that they excavate in loose soil. Yellow-throated scrubwrens are unique in their genus for building suspended nests, up to 1m (3.3ft) long, often set over streams and resembling flood debris. Gerygones build purselike suspended nests with long tails and a hooded entrance, sometimes close to wasps' nests. The Rock warbler's nest is often suspended from the roof of a cave. Entrance to the Banded whiteface's nest chamber is through a funnel up to 20cm (8in) long and 3cm (1.2in) in diameter; its function is unknown. Yellow-rumped thornbills build the most curious nest. It is domed with a concealed side entrance and a false “cup nest” built conspicuously on top, possibly to fool predators or brood parasites.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite their domed nests, Australian warblers are frequent victims of cuckoo parasitism. Fan-tailed cuckoos (Cacomantis flabelliformis) often parasitize scrubwrens and thornbills, and all of the bronze-cuckoos commonly lay in the nests of the smaller species. Rufous bronze-cuckoos (Chrysococcyx ruficollis) lay specifically in suspended nests, such as those of gerygones, and Black-eared cuckoos (C. osculans) parasitize a variety of Australian warblers, particularly those species that lay uniform brown eggs similar to the cuckoo's own.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many Australian warblers have sweet or complex songs, which can include mimicry or duetting. The simple, bell-like notes of pardalotes ring from eucalypt forests and woodlands throughout Australia. Gerygones (the name itself means “born of sound”) have simple but delightful songs, often in a descending melody. Several species are gifted mimics, including the Yellow-throated scrubwren, the Speckled warbler, and the Chestnut-rumped hylacola, which weaves the songs of many species into a canary-like song. Pilotbirds and bristlebirds have clear, far-carrying songs that often include duetting. Not all Australian warblers delight the human ear, however; some have mechanical or buzzy voices.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cooperative breeding and pair-breeding are both common, even within genera. In many species, some sons remain on the natal territory and become “helpers” in its defense, and in raising subsequent young. Such cooperative breeding is the norm in scrubwrens and thornbills, and also occurs in pardalotes, gerygones, and probably other genera; it may be the ancestral breeding condition in this family. Speckled warblers are perhaps unique in that males always disperse from their natal territory, but may then become resident on the territory of an unrelated breeding pair. In the non-breeding season, some species form flocks composed of adjacent breeding groups.
