		<h1>Crow</h1>
		<p>
			Members of the family corvidae are familiar to most people who live where they occur because the birds are usually large, noisy, and obvious. Some, such as the House crow, are specialists at coexisting with people and have been living in towns for centuries. Others, including the American and the Torresian crows, have only recently moved into urban areas, but are now living there in large numbers. Blue jays are one of the most common birds at feeders throughout North America, and are spreading their range westward, taking advantage of human hospitality.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of their size, color, apparent intelligence, and scavenging ways, crows figure prominently in folklore. In Europe, ravens and crows have often been seen as birds of ill omen, probably because of their role as scavengers on battlefields. Common ravens have a more positive role in native North American tradition, where they are seen as creators and folk heroes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today people still have strongly divided opinions on the subject of crows. Many see them as evil, noisy nest predators that need to be controlled; others, however, admire them for their humanlike intelligence and sociality.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The crow family contains the largest of all passerines, the ravens, as well as a wide variety of smaller jays, magpies, and other species. Some are regarded as the most intelligent of all birds. Many of the species are woodland dwellers; indeed, most of the jays and magpies of Asia and South America are almost confined to forests. However, most of the familiar species of Europe and North America prefer more open habitats, and none of the African or Australian representatives are forest birds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most widespread and familiar group comprises the typical crows and ravens of the genus Corvus. These are large birds with tails of short or medium length and plumage that is all black, black and white, black and gray, or entirely sooty-brown. In Europe the genus is represented by the Common raven, the Carrion and Hooded crows, the rook, and the Eurasian jackdaw; in southern Asia by the House and Jungle crows among others; and in Africa by species including the Pied crow and White-necked raven. In North America and again in Australia there are a number of all-black crows that resemble each other rather closely in structure and appearance but differ in their voices. Thus the American, Fish, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas crows are more readily separable by voice than appearance, and in Australia the Torresian crow, Little crow, Australian raven and others are difficult to identify except by their calls. The genus Corvus has been more successful than others of the family in colonizing remote islands, resulting in the development of species with local distributions in the West Indies, Indonesia, the southwest Pacific, and Hawaii.
		</p>
		<p>
			A number of long-tailed crows are given the name “magpie,” although they are unlikely to be closely related. These include not only the familiar piebald magpies of Europe, Asia, and North America, but also a number of more brightly-colored species from southern Asia such as the Green and Blue magpies. They all have short, strong bills and very long, graduated tails, which in the Asian magpies are decorated with white and black spots. The dividing line between the Asian magpies and jays relies mainly on the length of the tail, but the real relationships of these species remain to be worked out. The treepies of southeast Asia all have relatively short but strongly curved upper beaks, and long tails whose central tail feathers have rounded tips that are slightly to extremely expanded. The Ratchet-tailed treepie has flared, pointed tips to all its graduated tail feathers, resulting in an unusual, jagged appearance.
		</p>
		<p>
			The American jays (not including the Gray jay, a representative of the Old World group) are distinct from the rest of the family. Many of the species are of rather small size, some of them no bigger than large thrushes. The Brown jay, however, is as large as a small crow, and the two species of magpie-jays have extremely long, ornate tails, much like the Asian magpies. Most of the American jays have blue in their plumage, although a few are brown or bluish-gray.
		</p>
		<p>
			The adaptability and versatility of crows show most clearly in their diets and feeding behavior. Most species take both animal and plant foods, with large insects and small nuts being especially important. Many are quick to exploit new and artificial food sources. The manipulation of food is made easier by the robust, generalized bill that is widespread in the family, and in most species also by use of the feet to hold food while it is dismembered. Many species use only the lower mandible to peck objects held between the feet, and the American jays have developed a special, bony buttress on the lower jaw to make this motion even more efficient. Many species have been recorded “dunking” or washing food, perhaps to counter stickiness or to soften hard items. Food-hiding is also prevalent in the family (see Squirreling Crows). The New Caledonian crow constructs tools to assist in food gathering, modifying twigs and leaves to probe into tree holes and cavities in search of insect larvae. New Caledonian crows construct different types of tools in different localities, and some are unique in the animal world in fashioning hooks to extract prey.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has often been suggested that crows can survive on almost any food, but the poor physical condition of many captive specimens strongly implies that their nutritional requirements are similar to those of most other birds. In fact, being omnivorous is no guarantee of food availability, and many crow species cannot find enough food to feed all the chicks they hatch.
		</p>
		<p>
			The longevity of crows has probably been overestimated by casual observers because of the birds' tendency to persist from generation to generation in suitable territories. Thus we have the old folk saying that “A crow lives three times as long as a man, and a raven lives three times as long as a crow.” In reality, the maximum age recorded in captivity for a Common raven is 29 years, and that bird died of senile decay, suggesting that wild birds do not often live as long. Recoveries of ringed birds of several crow species show that one-third to one-half of young birds may die in their first year, and that few adults live to be older than 10 years. Still, such survival rates are quite high for birds, and some of the larger crows would thus appear by passerine standards to be long-lived.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			A majority of members of the crow family defend exclusive breeding territories in which they nest. As examples, the Common raven, Eurasian jay, and Western scrub-jay all defend territories from which both birds of the pair threaten intruders. A few species nest colonially, notably the Eurasian jackdaw, which has rather loosely spaced colonies nesting in holes, and the rook, which nests in denser colonies in the tops of trees. The colonial nesters are gregarious throughout the year, and many of the species that hold breeding territories flock outside the breeding season, some of them occupying large communal roosts. Others, such as the Florida scrub-jay, defend their territories vigorously throughout the year. American crows hold territories year-round, but gather in large foraging groups and roosts at certain times of year, defending the territory during the day but joining others to sleep off-territory at night. Studies of marked birds of several species have shown that the same territories are occupied year after year and that the pair-bond often lasts for life. Some Florida scrub-jays may never leave their natal territory throughout their lives, breeding in the very spot where they were hatched.
		</p>
		<p>
			Several different crow species have breeding seasons that are timed to take advantage of peak food supplies for the nestlings. Thus, rooks lay in March in England to take advantage of an April peak in earthworm abundance, whereas the Eurasian jay lays in late April or May to benefit from the late May and early June peak in the numbers of defoliating caterpillars on trees.
		</p>
		<p>
			A number of species are cooperative breeders, with more than two birds attending a nest and feeding the young. Most frequently, the extra birds are offspring of the breeding pair that have stayed at home for one or more years. Such a lifestyle is especially prevalent in the American jays. Among the Corvus crows, cooperative breeding is known only in certain populations of American and Carrion crows. American crow families can include 15 individuals, all offspring of a single breeding pair, remaining at home for as many as six or more years. Several pairs of Mexican jays may have active nests concurrently in a single group territory, and individual jays may feed young in several nests within their flock's territory. Once the chicks fledge, all adults in the group feed the young from all nests. Studies examining the DNA of these groups indicate that young in one nest may, in fact, be the offspring of several different sets of parents. In contrast, the closely related Florida scrub-jay is a more simple cooperative breeder, in that all the young in a nest are the offspring of the single breeding pair.
		</p>
		<p>
			The female alone incubates in most species (both sexes in nutcrackers), and the female is usually fed on the nest by the male and any helpers. Because incubation often starts before the last egg of the clutch is laid, the nestlings can hatch over a period of several days and so may differ in size. When food is short, the smallest of the brood often dies. In some Corvus species, the smallest nestlings may be discarded just after hatching, decreasing competition among the rest for limited food supplies. Both parents feed the young on food that is mostly carried to the nest concealed in the birds' throats. The fledglings of most, if not all, species are fed by their parents for some weeks after they leave the nest, and in at least some species they may remain in the parents' territory for many months after they become independent. In cooperatively breeding species they may stay for years, or even leave for weeks or months and then return.
