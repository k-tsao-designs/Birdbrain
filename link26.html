		<h1>Cuckoo Shrike</h1>
		<p>
			Cuckoo-shrikes, sometimes known as caterpillar-birds, are not related to either shrikes or cuckoos, although the majority have shrike-like bills and resemble cuckoos in size and plumage colors or patterns. They are a family of two distinct groups: the cuckoo-shrikes (8 genera, 72 species), which are generally drab in color and range from sparrow- to pigeon-sized; and the brightly colored minivets of the genus Pericrocotus (13 species), which are much more active, gregarious, and wagtail-like in size and shape.
		</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Cuckoo-shrikes have long, pointed wings, moderately long tails (either graduated or rounded), and well-developed rictal bristles that in many species cover the nostrils. Many species, including Campephaga, Coracina, and the Pericrocotus minivets, have spinelike shafts to erectile feathers on the rump and lower back. These are not normally visible, but are raised in defensive display and are easily shed. The newly hatched young of some genera such as Campephaga, Hemipus, and Tephrodornis are covered with white or gray down and, later, finely barred feathers that blend in perfectly with the nest and its environment. The sexes are usually separable, sometimes strikingly so, as for example in the African Campephaga species, but the fledglings are similar to adult females.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trillers are small birds, often pied in color. The White-winged triller is unique in the family in that the male molts from a black and white breeding dress into a non-breeding dress that is similar to the female's plumage, with brown above and white lightly streaked with brown below.
		</p>
		<p>
			In contrast, the minivets are dainty and strikingly colored, and have narrow wings, a prominent wing bar, and a long, strongly graduated tail. There is a marked difference between the sexes, while juveniles are similarly colored and patterned to adult females but not so prominently. The Scarlet minivet is bright red, heightened by black areas on the head, throat, back, most of the wings, and central tail feathers. The female is just as striking, with yellow replacing the red, and the black extending to the chin, throat, and forehead. The least striking of the group, but still handsome, is the Ashy minivet; in this species the male has a gray back and rump, a black and white tail, a prominent black nape and crown, and white on the forehead and underparts.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Most of the family are gregarious at times. Minivets, in particular, are usually found in noisy, colorful parties of 20 or more birds as they move through the treetops in search of insects. Most species form part of the mixed feeding flocks characteristic of the forests and open woodlands of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Flycatcher-shrikes do the same, but they and some trillers also catch many insects on the wing, using their relatively short bill and wide gape. Wood-shrikes are more cumbersome and slower-moving when feeding; they catch some insects in flight, but will also feed on the ground when necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			The larger Coracina cuckoo-shrikes also form loose feeding parties, eating some fruit as well as insects as they pass through the forest canopy. Most trillers also eat fruit and insects, but the Black-breasted triller, a montane forest species, is thought to eat only fruit. Some trillers feed mainly on the ground, and the Ground cuckoo-shrike forages entirely terrestrially, walking about in small groups with a diet almost entirely of small animals.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The courtship and breeding behaviors of the family have been little studied. The male Scarlet minivet pursues the female into the air, seizes her tail in his bill, and they then spiral down together, only breaking apart just before returning to their perches. Such flights above the canopy seem to be a feature of all minivets, but may also be territorial in function, as a similar spiraling descent has been recorded for a male White-winged triller when defending its territory. The male Black cuckoo-shrike performs a mothlike, fluttering flight, with tail fanned and depressed, during its courtship display. In the courtship display of some larger cuckoo-shrikes, the male lifts each wing alternately every few seconds, calling vigorously and repeating the sequence at intervals. However, females also flick their wings, and wing-flicking seems characteristic of the group as a whole, usually as a comfort movement immediately after landing but also at times of excited interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some species, such as the White-winged triller, the Larger cuckoo-shrike, and the flycatcher shrikes, both sexes take part in nest building, incubation, and feeding the young. In others, such as the Scarlet and Flame-colored minivets, males feed the nestlings and help a little in nest building, whereas in a few (notably the Black cuckoo-shrike) the male only helps feed the nestlings, although he may accompany the female while she builds the nest and guards the nest area during incubation.
