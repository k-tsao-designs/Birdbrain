		<h1>Bustard</h1>
		<p>
			Bustards owe their name – by derivation “slow bird,” from their walking gait – to the most northerly and perhaps least typical member of the family, the Great bustard, to which it was first applied. Yet the term is appropriate for the family as a whole, for all bustards are strictly ground-dwellers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest bustards are to the open plains of Africa and Eurasia what cranes are to the world's big marshes: slow-breeding, long-lived birds of ancient lineage, reaching considerable size and weight while retaining the capacity to fly – among birds, the ultimate expression of adaptation to stable habitats. Sadly, like cranes, they are among the first to suffer once those habitats start being exploited and disrupted by humans.
		</p>
	
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The bustards are a homogeneous family, although there are differences in structure, color, size, and behavior that cloud the relationships between species. All are rather long-necked and long-legged, with robust bodies and short bills, and have lost both the hind toe and the preen gland that most birds possess. These losses, together with the camouflage patterning (often exquisitely delicate) of black on buff, rufous, or brown on their upperparts, are presumably adaptations to the dry, open landscapes they inhabit. Hindclaws are associated with birds that perch on trees or bushes, and oil from preen (uropygial) glands is used by most birds for waterproofing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The smaller species – the Little, Savile's, Buff-crested, and Red-crested bustards – have relatively short legs and necks. These, and most of the Eupodotis bustards, fly with rapid wingbeats; the larger species use slow, deep, powerful beats, but fly deceptively fast. On the ground, bustards are strong but usually slow walkers, characteristically nervous and alert: they move into cover at the first sign of danger, or freeze into a flattened posture and rely on their cryptic plumage for camouflage.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Bustards take their food in a slow, meandering walk through an area of grassland or scrub. Their diet is chiefly invertebrates, usually snapped up from the ground or off plants, but also sometimes dug up with the powerful bill. Small vertebrates and large insects such as locusts may also be taken, often after a short pursuit and pounce. All species readily eat vegetable matter, especially plant shoots, certain flowers, and fruit. Some larger species, notably Ardeotis, feed on the gum that oozes from acacia trees. Very few bustards appear to seek out fresh water, preferring to get sufficient liquid through their diet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Concentrations of food may cause a bird to remain in one spot for some time. In Somalia birds have been observed leaping to snatch berries off the higher parts of a bush, and in Zimbabwe Denham's bustard has been seen to wade into water, apparently in quest of young frogs, and to defend a termites' nest at which it was feeding against other birds. Several species gather at bush fires to take fleeing and crippled insects. Bustards have no crop, but their powerful gizzard, their long “blind gut” (cecum), and their habit of taking up quantities of grit assist the digestion of food.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			No male bustard has been observed to incubate eggs, an emancipation from parental duties that appears to reflect the lack of any pair-bonding in the family. Instead it appears that, in the larger species, males have a lek display in which they advertise themselves to any females in the vicinity. In South Africa, for example, Denham's bustard males seem to display in response to each other and any passing female, and may eventually mate with several females, the males keeping at least 700m (2,300ft) apart. Male Great bustards also operate a similar dispersed lek system, but in this species many males appear not to be territorial, instead moving about, keeping their distance from each other, and displaying at various sites (see Spectacular Courtship Displays). In this and the houbara and Australian bustard, two other species that also do not appear to form pair bonds, the display before copulation is very long and is often impeded by rivals; in these species, territoriality is replaced by simple opportunism and/or a ranking system.
		</p>
		<p>
			In southern Africa, birds with black underparts in the genus Eupodotis occur in quite dense grassland and savanna, give striking aerial displays, and apparently hold group territories within which one pair breeds. The newly-hatched young of all species are precocial and very soon leave the nest, but they are fed bill-to-bill by the mother initially and remain in her company for some months after hatching. Great and Little bustards are notably sociable and sometimes occur in flocks; the remaining species are more solitary, although some are commonly found in small groups.
		</p>
		<p>
			Male bustards are remarkable for their spectacular courtship displays. The Great bustard 1 inflates its neck like a balloon, cocks its tail forward onto its back, and stretches its wings back and down from shoulder to carpal. The primary feathers are kept folded so that their tips are held behind the bird's head, while the secondary feathers are lifted outward to form huge white rosettes on either side of the body. Together with the billowing undertail coverts, this posture transforms a richly colored (if partly camouflaged) animal into one that is nearly all-white. The pose may be held for minutes on end, and the bird is visible over great distances on spring mornings and evenings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Male Australian 2 and Great Indian bustards cock the tail forward and inflate the neck downward so that it becomes a broad sack that swings around like a punchbag, scraping the ground. The kori simply inflates its neck into a puffy white ball and trails its wings. The oddest of the ground displays is that of the houbara 3, which raises its white neck-ruff right over its head, fluffs out the body plumage until it resembles a large white puffball, and then begins a high-stepping trot around an irregular path, with very little indication that it can see where it is going.
		</p>
		<p>
			The small Black-bellied bustards of Africa and India give impressive display-flights or display-leaps above the grass that otherwise conceals them. Both species of florican make vertical leaps of up to 4m (13ft), but the most exciting aerial display is that of the Red-crested bustard, which flies vertically up as much as 30m (100ft) above the ground, somersaults backward with legs uppermost, then drops like a stone, pulling out at the last moment and gliding nonchalantly down to land. On the ground, too, this bird has a beautiful display, fully erecting its crest and employing stiff, clockworklike movements as it approaches a female.
		</p>
		<h2>Conservation and Environment</h2>
		<p>
			Bustards are little known, largely because of the difficulty of studying nervous, well-camouflaged, slow-breeding birds that tend to desert their nests if alarmed. This susceptibility to disturbance is a major cause of their decline, especially in northern parts of the family's distribution, where grasslands are coming under ever more pressure from agriculture. Great bustards can tolerate a degree of disturbance – indeed, they can only have colonized much of Europe thanks to felling of the forests by humans – but the mechanization of agriculture and the reduction of croplands to monocultures by the use of herbicides and fertilizers have been disastrous for them. Farming of the steppes reduced the Russian population from 8,650 birds at the start of the 1970s to an estimated 2,980 by the end of the decade. Similarly, the Little bustard is now nearly extinct almost everywhere in Europe except the Iberian Peninsula, as a result of the disappearance of herb-rich grasslands.
		</p>
		<p>
			A similar loss of habitat has brought all three Indian species to the brink of extinction. Both floricans are seriously endangered. The Bengal species – which now numbers fewer than 1,000 individuals – survives only in a widely fragmented chain of protected areas along the foothills of the Himalayas, and in two small areas of central Cambodia and southern Vietnam. The Lesser florican appears to be restricted to tiny, scattered patches of grassland (vidis) in the far west of India, maintained as reserve grazing but in no other way protected, although the hunting of this species has recently been banned. In the Himalayan foothills the grasslands have largely been converted to tea estates, while in western India they are being converted to pasture; in neither case can the florican concerned survive the change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the Great Indian bustard is perhaps more tolerant of agriculture, its populations have been steadily declining for decades. This species also now numbers fewer than 1,000 birds, but is currently showing signs of recovery in Rajasthan. The decline of its closest relative, the Australian bustard, is commonly attributed to continued, remorseless, indiscriminate shooting from the earliest days of European settlement, but it nonetheless seems certain that conversion of its habitat to farmland is the major factor in its disappearance.
		</p>
		<p>
			The decline of the houbara is plainly the direct result of hunting. This is the one species of bustard figuring strongly in human culture, as the most prized quarry in the Arab tradition of falconry. In recent years, oil wealth and technology have vastly increased the scale and efficiency of such hunting, and it is feared that in many parts of its range the houbara has been almost completely extirpated. A captive-breeding program has now been established in Saudi Arabia, partly to study the bird's breeding biology and to reintroduce it into areas where it has been drastically reduced through persecution. Unfortunately, bustard hunting by Arabs appears to be growing in parts of Africa, notably the Saharo-Sahelian zone, and certain other species – particularly the Nubian bustard – have suffered alarming declines as a result.
		</p>
		<p>
			No other purely African bustard is known to be seriously at risk, although the restricted ranges of the Blue and Little brown bustards must be cause for sustained vigilance. Moreover, throughout Africa the pressure to grow more food is unrelenting, and it cannot be long before some of these peace-loving ground-dwellers emerge as new candidates for extinction.
