		<h1>Crab Plover</h1>
		<p>
			The sole representative of its family, the Crab plover is instantly recognizable by its massive bill and pied plumage. Looking somewhat like a cross between an avocet and an oversized plover, this curious, little-studied bird inhabits the sandy beaches and mudflats of the African and Asian coasts of the Indian Ocean.
		</p>

		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Crab plovers are highly gregarious at all seasons and usually feed in flocks of 20 or more, searching the intertidal zone for crabs, which are easily broken by their powerful bills. Crab plovers tend to be nocturnal, as they feed on tropical fiddler crabs that emerge at dusk to feed and find mates.
		</p>
			
		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Outside the breeding season, the birds spread out along the coasts of Africa and India, reaching as far south as Natal and, sporadically, east to Malaysia and north to Turkey. In the wintering areas their gregarious habit persists, large flocks forming to fly to and from the traditional roosting sites. On several occasions, flocks have been observed to gather in order to mob a human hunter who has shot one of their number.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Compared to the large area of occurrence, the species' breeding range is restricted to a small number of offshore islands between Somalia and Iran. Crab plovers breed colonially, and thousands may congregate in an area of just a few thousand square meters (up to about 1.5 acres).
		</p>
		<p>
			Colonies are confined to areas of sand and dunes. The birds dig a tunnel up to 2m (6.6ft) long, using both bill and feet, and enlarge a chamber at the end in which the single egg is laid. This feature is surprising in a long-legged bird, and unique among shorebirds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unusually for a shorebird, the chicks remain in the nest until well after they are fully grown, possibly as a precaution against predation by the crabs that will later be their prey. Food is brought to them by both parents. After leaving the nest, the chicks apparently take some time to learn how to successfully tackle an angry crab, but food-begging by young birds is frequently seen in family groups in the wintering areas.
