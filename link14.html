		<h1>Bulbul</h1>
		<p>
			Bulbuls are a well-defined group of small birds that vary only from sparrow- to thrush-sized. The long, oval nostrils have a thin sheet of bone at the back that is usually pierced by one or two small nerve canals, and is their most definitive feature. More obvious characteristics are the fine, hairlike feathers that protrude from the nape (sufficiently long in some species to form a distinct crest), and the long, fluffy feathers on the back.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bulbuls are mainly forest-dwelling birds, but a number of species prefer the forest edge, and some have adapted to drier woodlands, to savanna, and to cultivated areas. All exist in the Old World, and they are often the commonest, or at least the most frequently heard, birds in the Afrotropical (including the Malagasy) and the Oriental regions. The name “bulbul” is Arabian in origin and is probably imitative of the bird's calls, but is also used as a common name for the family in Iraq and India.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			In addition to the distinctive bone and feather features mentioned above, bulbuls can also be recognized by their short wings, more curved from front to back than in most other birds and each with 10 primary feathers, of which the outermost is much shorter than the rest. The tail of 12 feathers is medium in length and may be square or slightly rounded, forked or graduated. Bulbuls have a short neck, and in most species the bill is relatively slender, slightly downcurved, weakly notched or hooked, and with very well-developed bristles around the gape. Two seed- and insect-eating species of Asia, the finch-billed bulbuls in the genus Spizixos, are notable exceptions that also have a forward-pointing crest. The legs of bulbuls are short, and the rather weak feet that support the slender body are suited mainly to an arboreal rather than a terrestrial existence, even though several forest species feed mainly while hopping on the ground or clinging to bark and lichen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most open-country bulbuls are active, alert, noisy, gregarious birds, full of character and movement. Some forest bulbuls attract attention by special foraging movements, such as flicking a wing or tail, but many are cryptic as they move through the foliage and undergrowth. Bulbuls often feed in flocks with other species, usually as followers rather than leaders, but they are almost always the first to give warning of a potential predator, and they often attract the attention of naturalists to rarer birds such as owls. Those species that feed on or near the ground often follow columns of army ants for the insects they disturb, while some of the more arboreal species follow monkeys and squirrels.
		</p>
		<p>
			As one would expect of birds with such short, rounded wings, bulbuls are feeble flyers, poor at colonizing islands and not very migratory. A few species migrate from one altitude to another, especially in Asia where they occur from sea level to 3,000m (10,000ft) up in the Himalayas. Only one species, the Brown-eared bulbul that occurs in Japan and northeastern China, appears to be a true migrant, and even then it is only its more northerly populations that migrate, wintering as far south as Korea and moving by day, often in large flocks of up to a thousand birds.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The nesting of bulbuls is relatively straightforward, and their nuptial displays make the most of their distinctive features. The male Red-vented bulbul, whose mating display is typical of the many Pycnonotus species, depresses and spreads its tail laterally to show off the bright crimson undertail coverts while fluttering its spread wings up and down above its head. In the frugivorous Yellow-whiskered greenbul of Africa, the normally solitary males gather to sing in social leks, which females visit for mating but thereafter ignore as they rear the young alone. Several other bulbuls are known to breed in cooperative groups, among them the Swamp, Yellow-breasted, and Spotted greenbuls and the Terrestrial brownbul, and this behavior may well be more widespread given the number of species that normally live in cohesive social groups.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most species that are not social live as territorial pairs, at least for the duration of the breeding season. Both sexes usually take part in building the nest, which is located in the fork of a tree or a bush, often in an open, poorly concealed location. The nest is a simple but substantial cup, loosely built of plant materials through which rainwater can easily drain away, and sometimes bound together by fungi. Most nests are situated relatively low down, at a height of 0.5–9m (5–30ft), although nests of the Madagascar and Seychelles bulbuls have been recorded at over 15m (50ft). Many nests are found by predators, including snakes, cats, crows, and lizards, and a number of bulbul species are parasitized by different species of cuckoos. Both parents take turns to incubate the eggs, which in many species are extremely beautiful, often having unusually thick shells for birds of their size. Both parents feed the chicks once they hatch, and often more than one brood is reared in a year. Despite the birds' superficially dull appearance, further study of the feeding and breeding biology of bulbuls is expected to reveal considerable diversity, as well as many new adaptations.
