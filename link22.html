		<h1>Cotinga</h1>
		<p>
			The neotropical cotingas are among the most diverse of all bird groupings. They exhibit the largest variation in body size of any avian family, ranging from the diminutive Kinglet calyptura at about 8cm (3in) to the crow-sized umbrellabirds. Cotingas vary in their ecology from insectivores to specialist frugivores. In plumage, they range from the drab to the spectacular, and in their breeding systems they include species that form both monogamous pairs and polygynous leks.
		</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Because of their ecological and behavioral diversity, cotingas vary extensively in body size, plumage, and morphology. In their proportions, they range from short-winged, heavily-built birds – for example the Andean fruiteaters (Pipreola) – through the huge, broad-winged umbrellabirds to the small, long-winged, almost swallowlike purpletufts. In color they extend from highly dimorphic species with brilliantly ornamented males to species in which both sexes are uniformly gray or brown. The brilliant colors include vivid red, yellow, pink, and purple hues created by carotenoid pigments, and blue hues that are structurally formed by interference among light waves scattered off air bubbles in the feather barbs, as in the eponymous Cotinga species.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many species show elaborate, sexually dimorphic plumages and specialized feathers, such as the crests on male cocks-of-the-rock. An example of plumage modification that appears in both sexes is the long, forked tail of the highly aerial Swallow-tailed cotinga, which is produced by feathers of differing lengths. Various species have evolved fleshy wattles, feathered carbuncles, or bare skin patches that are associated with courtship display, as in the capuchinbird, the bellbirds, and the umbrellabirds. A few species, such as the red cotingas and the cocks-of-the-rock, have specialized flight feathers that are used for the production of mechanical sounds during courtship displays. Other species, including the Elegant mourner, the Scimitar-winged piha, the becards, and the tityras, have oddly-shaped primaries whose function is unknown.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cotingas vary extensively in bill size and shape. Many frugivorous species have a wide gape to facilitate the swallowing of large fruits. The plantcutters have a conical bill with a serrate tomium (cutting edge) that they use for feeding on buds, leaves, fruits, and seeds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The syrinx, or vocal organ, of the cotingas is also extremely variable. The family includes some of the simplest and the most complex syringes found among all birds. Many species have extremely basic syringes, with no specialized supporting elements or intrinsic muscles. The resulting vocalizations are simple as well. Other genera that have evolved loud vocalizations for their polygynous displays have highly-derived syringes with many unique features. Fruitcrows have an enlarged trachea and bronchi that create a resonance for low, booming calls. The bellbirds have a huge and highly muscular syrinx that creates some of the loudest sounds in the bird world.
		</p>
		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Cotingas are exclusively Neotropical, ranging from northern Mexico to southern South America. The Rose-throated becard is a regular but rare nesting species in the extreme southwestern United States. Most species are found in humid tropical rain forests, humid montane forests, or upper montane forests. In contrast, plantcutters are found in shrub-dominated open country and crop lands of the Andes and southern South America.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			The diets of cotingas are very diverse. The core cotingas, Andean cotingas, and the Rupicolinae are largely frugivorous. Smaller species eat a variety of small fruits, whereas larger species often specialize on larger fruits in the avocado family (Lauraceae). The White-cheeked cotinga specializes on High-Andean mistletoe berries. The plantcutters feed on plant buds, fruits, and seeds with their serrate, conical bills. In contrast, the tityras, mourners, becards, and sharpbill are extensively insectivorous. As in manakins, birds of paradise, bowerbirds, and others, frugivory is hypothesized to be associated with the evolution of polygynous breeding systems because it may help release males from parental care.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The breeding behaviors of the cotingas include a wide variety of those found among all birds. Andean cotingas, plantcutters, fruiteaters, tityras, and becards are apparently monogamous, with biparental care. The Purple-throated fruitcrow is highly social and lives in mixed groups of males and females. One female apparently builds the nests and does all the incubation, but all individuals cooperate to defend the territory and bring insects to the single nestling. Apparently, there is a single main pair with additional helpers of either sex. It is not known whether the helpers are young of the main pair born in previous years. The purpletufts appear in social groups and may have a similarly cooperative breeding system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though much remains to be learned about their breeding behavior, most cotinga species are apparently polygynous, with exclusively female parental care. Males of polygynous species often gather to perform courtship displays in leks. Some species have highly concentrated traditional leks; for example, male Guianan cocks-of-the-rock display in large groups of 10 to 20 birds or more. Each male maintains a cleared “court” on the forest floor, a system similar to that of the White-bearded manakin (Manacus manacus). The main courtship display is static: the male crouches in the middle of his court with his brilliant plumage spread and the head turned sideways so that the semi-circular topknot is fully displayed to the females who come into the trees above the lek. Other cotinga species have highly dispersed or solitary display areas. Males of some canopy species (for example, Cotinga, Xipholena, and Carpodectes) aggregate in specific treetops or adjacent trees, but these breeding systems are harder to study and are less well-known.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cotinga display behavior can include physical elements, such as postures and stylized movements in the cocks-of-the-rock and red cotingas, or primarily vocal advertisements. Strong sexual selection in some groups, such as the bellbirds and in the Screaming piha, has led to the evolution of some of the loudest vocalizations in all birds. Bellbird vocalizations, which vary from a loud bock to a ringing electronic gong-geeh, can be heard well over 1km (0.6 miles) away. The larger fruitcrows have low, mooing calls, while the capuchinbird gives a loud whine that crescendoes like a revving chain saw or motorcycle. The Black -and-gold cotinga, which inhabits montane forests of southeastern Brazil, utters a beautiful and ethereal pure-tone whistle that slowly rises in pitch over a timespan of three seconds. Often groups of males will sing antiphonally, producing a continuous ringing whine characterized by undulating beat frequencies
		</p>
		<p>
			Cotingas also exhibit a surprising variety of nest structures. The cryptically-colored females of many species build simple platform nests of sticks that they tend single-handed, laying a single egg. The nest is so insubstantial that the egg is often visible through the bottom. Such inconspicuousness may be an adaptation to reduce predation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mourners, fruiteaters, and Andean cotingas build more substantial cup nests. The female cock-of-the-rock builds her nest of mud and rootlets, hardened with saliva, against a vertical rockface, perhaps as another form of protection. (As a result, cocks-of-the-rock are limited in distribution within humid forests to areas with boulders, rock faces, or cliffs.) The becards build woven, pendent nests, while the tityras nest in cavities. The purpletufts build a tiny cup nest on the upper surface of a branch that is reminiscent of a hummingbird's nest.
