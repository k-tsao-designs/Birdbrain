		<h1>Bush Shrikes</h1>
		<p>
			Given their habitats, bush-shrikes are globally much less conspicuous than shrikes, but their songs and calls betray their presence – for example the far-carrying whistles of the Malaconotus species or the extraordinary duets of the gonoleks. Like the shrikes, all bush-shrikes have a sharply hooked and notched bill. Most of the birds are extraordinarily beautiful.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Bush-shrikes are notable for their brilliantly-colored plumage. The widespread Grey-headed bush-shrike, for instance, has a green back and yellow underparts; it is rather similar to the mainly West African Fiery-breasted bush-shrike, but the latter has different color morphs; there are birds with scarlet, yellow, or orange underparts! The Yellow-crowned gonolek, which is restricted to western Africa, is crimson below and black above, apart from a golden crown and undertail-coverts. Another member of the genus Laniarius, the Tropical boubou, is mainly black above and white below, whereas the Sooty boubou bears its name well and is uniformly black. The sexes are alike in the first two species, but in the Sooty boubou the female is somewhat duller, without gloss.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bush-shrikes are mainly insectivorous. They are not, however, sit-and-wait predators like shrikes; instead, they skulk in dense habitat, where they generally behave like oversized warblers and feed by gleaning the vegetation inside branches and foliage. According to species, prey may be taken at all forest levels; some, like the tchagras, hop on the ground and capture most of their prey items there. The large birds of the genus Malaconotus are equipped with a very powerful bill and are able to catch small vertebrates; like shrikes of the genus Lanius, they may also store their prey.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Distribution</h2>
		<p>
			Almost all bush-shrikes are endemic to Africa south of the Sahara; the only exception is the Black-crowned tchagra, also widespread in sub-Saharan Africa but with isolated races respectively in North Africa and in the southeast of the Arabian peninsula. Most genera have species that either inhabit dense tropical forest, both lowland and montane, or else open deciduous woodland. Thus the Northern and Sabine's puffbacks occur throughout West and Central Africa, the former in savanna woodland, the latter rather in lowland forests. However, some species, such as the brubru, are confined to savanna areas. Bush-shrikes are mostly sedentary, but local movements, including altitudinal ones, have been proved or suspected in some species.
		</p>
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			As far as known, all bush-shrikes appear to be normally monogamous and territorial. Their breeding season is favored by the rains. The courtship display of the majority of species has not been described, but it is well-known in a few, for instance in puffbacks, in which males puff out their rump feathers and look like puff-balls, and in tchagras, which have a typical display flight (wings extended, tail fanned out) accompanied by melodious phrases. Nests are often neatly-formed cups; they generally receive only 2 or 3 eggs. The breeding ecology of many species remains virtually unknown.
