		<h1>Cuckoo</h1>
		<p>
			A harbinger of spring, and the source of fascinating studies of the interactions between brood parasites and their host species, the European cuckoo is famous, even infamous. So firmly established is its bad reputation for usurping the place of others that it has become implanted in the English language, in the word “cuckold,” denoting a husband deceived by a philandering wife. Yet this well-studied bird, which breeds throughout temperate Europe and Asia, and which is more familiar from its call than its looks, is the exception; most cuckoos are poorly known tropical species. Moreover, not all species are parasitic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cuckoos are a very diverse family: the sturdy Greater roadrunner of North American deserts bears little resemblance to the delicate Klaas's cuckoo of the African bush. Details of internal anatomy, as well as the possession of feet with two toes pointing forward and two back (zygodactyly), distinguish cuckoos from the superficially similar songbirds and align them with parrots and nightjars. This unusual foot structure enables cuckoos to climb stealthily up slender reed stems or run swiftly over the ground with almost equal poise.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Many species resemble small hawks, having a distinctly downcurved bill and long tail, and share with hawks the discomfort of being “mobbed” by small songbirds. The reason for these unwelcome attentions is that many cuckoos reproductively parasitize the smaller birds. About 57 species have no other habit of reproduction than to place their eggs in the nests of other species. These include all the species in the subfamily Cuculinae plus the three parasitic American ground-cuckoos. Debate continues about how many times the parasitic habit has arisen in the evolutionary past.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The European cuckoo female defends a territory within which she keeps a close eye on the comings and goings of the resident songbirds. In fact she is primarily concerned with only one of the resident species, for her eggs are characteristic in color and will closely match the eggs of only one potential host species. When a suitable nest becomes available, usually one in which laying is underway, the cuckoo flies warily down, takes one or more host eggs in her bill, and quickly deposits a single egg in the nest (see A Cuckoo in the Nest). She then departs, all within 10 seconds. The mimicry of the egg color, and the relatively small size of the cuckoo's own egg ensure that the clutch appears untouched when the rightful owner returns. Having successfully completed this delicate operation, the cuckoo eats the stolen egg as reward for its stealth!
		</p>
		<p>
			The cuckoo egg develops extremely rapidly and, even if some host eggs were already partly incubated when parasitism occurred, is generally the first in the nest to hatch. At this point the European cuckoo nestling displays the remarkable adaptation of egg or hatchling ejection, which was first described in detail in 1788 by the English physician Edward Jenner (the inventor of vaccination). The cuckoo continues to push out all other objects around it until it is left as the sole occupant of the nest. In so doing, it eliminates any possible competition and thereby ensures that its foster parents concentrate their reproductive efforts on one thing – the raising of the voracious cuckoo! Even if the foster parents are sitting on the nest while this tragedy unfolds, they do not intervene to stop the cuckoo's slaughter of their own young.
		</p>
		<p>
			This pattern is not invariable among the cuckoos. Many species, for instance the Great spotted cuckoo, the Channel-billed cuckoo, and the Asian koel, do not show ejection behavior. Instead, the young share the nest with offspring of the host species, in these species usually crows. Yet the rapidly growing and more active cuckoo nestling either tramples the crow chicks to death underfoot or, more subtly, monopolizes the food brought to the nest by its foster parents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even after hatching, the cuckoo nestling must continue the deception to be able to obtain food from its foster parents. This trickery seems to be achieved by the cuckoo exploiting the signals that usually pass between parent and offspring in the nest. The Great spotted cuckoo produces a passable imitation of the begging calls of nestling magpies, and its wide-open gape is even more vivid than those of the host nestlings with which it shares a nest.
		</p>
		<p>
			So powerful is the stimulus of the cuckoo's vigorous begging that it can induce other birds to care for it even after it has left the nest; passing small birds that are neither the true nor the foster parents will bring food to the imploring bird!
		</p>
		<p>
			In an evolutionary sense, it is surprising that cuckoo nestlings succeed in obtaining parental care from foster parents, when selection against this behavior must be very strong indeed. Mimicry of egg color and size may increase the chances of host acceptance, and appear to be very finely tuned to the resident host population. For example, the Brown babbler (Turdoides plebejus) is a central African host species that, over most of its range, lays clear blue eggs, but in one part of northern Nigeria lays pink or mauve eggs. Incredibly, its cuckoo parasite has evolved to mimic faithfully these changes in coloration. The accuracy of this kind of local mimicry is presumably dependent upon a high degree of breeding site tenacity in both migratory and nonmigratory cuckoos: a female which tried to breed other than close to where she was hatched might find it more difficult to locate the correct hosts. It seems that this system is maintained because young females not only inherit egg color from their mothers but also tend to parasitize the same host as reared them. Thus, there are female-based lineages of cuckoos that are genetically distinct. However, they are not in the process of becoming new species, since males mate with females from any lineage, and promote gene flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			An evolutionary “half-way house” between full-scale cuckoo parasitism and the part-time parasitism of some other species (for example, the House sparrow, starling, and moorhen, which occasionally deposit eggs in the nest of conspecifics) is represented by Yellow-billed and Black-billed cuckoos. In most years, these species nest “normally.” When food, such as cicadas, is unusually abundant, however, each female also attempts to parasitize the nests of either conspecifics or other species, in addition to raising a brood herself. What ecological factors have caused the evolution of this mixed policy? The interesting features of these cuckoos is that they have very large eggs, relative to body size, and that these large eggs have an extraordinarily fast development time, hatching in only 11 days – the shortest incubation period of any bird! Rapidly hatching eggs are, of course, essential for successful parasitism because the host's nest will already contain developing eggs when discovered by the cuckoo. If the cuckoo's eggs hatch much later than those of the host, their chance of success will be very small.
		</p>
		<p>
			The extraordinary behavior of parasitic cuckoos tends to obscure the fact that about two-thirds of the species appear to be nonparasitic in their breeding habits, mating monogamously and remaining together while the offspring are reared. The Pheasant coucal is one such species, producing one or two grotesque black nestlings which, in common with many cuckoos, excrete a foul liquid when they suspect the presence of a predator. However, our knowledge of most species is extremely poor.
		</p>

		<h2>The Roadrunner, A Special Type of Cuckoo</h2>
		<p>
			Even the nonparasitic members of the cuckoo family turn out to be remarkable in other ways, a case in point being the Greater roadrunner. This ground-dwelling bird, which lives in the desert chapparal of Mexico and the US Southwest (with the greatest abundance in Arizona), was once heavily persecuted in the mistaken belief that it was harmful to populations of gamebirds. In fact, it eats an assortment of large invertebrates and is also a voracious predator on small lizards. A good turn of speed enables it to run down prey; it has been recorded running at 24km/h (15mph). Travelers' tall tales have embellished the reputation of the roadrunner: in one popular account the bird delicately wields a cactus leaf, teasing an angry rattlesnake until it strikes and becomes impaled on one of the bird's thorny weapons.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rather more reliably attested is the fact that this species displays a physiology that is most unusual among birds, being, to some extent, cold-blooded! When air temperatures become very low, during the desert night, most birds need to increase metabolism to maintain their internal body temperature at a constant, high level. This, of course, means burning internal food reserves at a greater rate. The roadrunner adopts a more economical approach – it simply allows its body temperature to fall slightly, turning down the “central heating” with no ill effects, and thereby saving energy. The bird does in fact go into a slight torpor and may not be able to respond as quickly to sudden danger, but for a creature with few predators, this disadvantage is of little consequence.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the first rays of dawn break the cool of the desert night, the roadrunner has a neat trick for warming up. Areas of skin on its back, located just between the wings, are darkly pigmented and absorb the energy of sunlight, warming the skin and the underlying blood vessels. To accelerate this process, the bird fluffs the feathers covering the patches so that the light penetrates more effectively. This rapid warming mechanism can save the roadrunner up to 50 percent of the energy it would otherwise need to warm up to a working temperature.
