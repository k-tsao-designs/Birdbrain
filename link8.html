		<h1>Babblers and Laughingthrushes</h1>
		<p>
			Some 285 different species are linked in the family Timaliidae, a diverse collection of mostly Old World forest birds that includes such subgroups as the African mountain babblers, the Southeast Asian tit-babblers, the Madagascan jerys, and the primarily Himalayan barwings, parrotbills, babaxes, sibias, yuhinas, and fulvettas. However, the laughingthrushes of the subfamily Garrulacinae form the family's main subdivision. A single monotypic species, the wrentit, is included here as the family's only New World representative.
		</p>
		<p>
			The birds are mostly insect-eaters (although some also take fruit), and they have soft, fluffy plumage. They also tend to be gregarious and noisy – hence the family's common name. For the rest, they are more notable for their differences than their similarities, ranging in size from tiny, wrenlike birds to others as big as thrushes, and in plumage from relatively dull, cryptic species of the underbrush like the Jungle babbler to the brightly-colored mesia and fulvettas.

		<h2>Babblers</h2>
		<p>
			Babblers are a varied group of small to medium-sized songbirds that form an important constituent of the bird populations of tropical Asia. Behavior and feeding ecology within the family are very diverse; it includes active leaf-gleaners flitting in the forest canopy like warblers and long-legged genera hopping on the ground like thrushes. The “average” babbler falls between a warbler and a thrush in size, with short, rounded wings and a longish tail. The birds forage in bushes, in low vegetation, and on the ground, but normally are not found far from some sort of cover. All are essentially sedentary, although a few mountain species may shift to lower altitudes in winter.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the middle altitudes of the Himalayas, at about 1,500–3,000m (5,000–10,000ft), babblers are the dominant passerines, with 50 species breeding in Nepal alone out of a resident passerine community of about 320 species. Here they are represented by a great diversity of types, from tiny wren babblers skulking among rotting logs on the forest floor to the large scimitar babblers, probing with their hoopoelike bills, and the Black-headed sibia, drinking the sap oozing from holes in the trunks of oak trees, after the fashion of sapsuckers. Other species scratch among leaf litter on the forest floor (Puff-throated babbler). The tiny White-browed fulvetta is among the commonest birds in subalpine scrub in the western Himalayas of India. Geographically close, but ecologically different, the mockingbird-like babaxes inhabit buckthorn scrub on the edge of the Tibetan plateau, in arid, high-altitude desert.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the evergreen rain forests of Southeast Asia and the temperate forests of the Himalayas, babblers are important members of the mixed feeding flocks of small, insect-eating birds that are characteristic of those environments. Species involved include minlas, yuhinas, tree babblers, tit-babblers, and shrike-babblers, which mix freely with warblers, tits, minivets, treecreepers and woodpeckers to form loosely organized parties, sometimes numbering several hundred birds, moving steadily through the forest throughout the day and only breaking up in the evening to roost in separate, single-species groups.
		</p>
		<p>
			In India the Common and Jungle babblers are familiar birds of the garden and roadside, moving in noisy bands from tree to tree or hopping about energetically on the ground. Parties of 5–15 birds consisting of extended families are the rule, with the whole group collaborating to incubate the eggs laid by the dominant female (and presumably fertilized by the dominant male). All members of the family assist in feeding the nestlings, which fledge after about 14 days.
		</p>
		<p>
			Groups of Jungle babblers defend collective territories; encounters between neighboring groups are very noisy, with most of the birds on each side calling excitedly. Fighting sometimes breaks out in these skirmishes, and antagonists can be seen rolling on the ground with claws locked together. Similar behavior is seen in mock fights that take place within groups, usually among the younger birds. Members of a group roost side by side at night on a horizontal branch, taking a long time to settle down because of constant switching of position. The eventual order leaves the senior members closest to the trunk, the immatures at the far end, and any juveniles in the middle.
		</p>
		<h2>Laughingthrushes</h2>
		<p>
			Laughingthrushes are robust, thrushlike birds of the forest floor and understory, with very strong legs and short, rounded wings. All are sedentary, although a few descend seasonally from higher altitudes. Most species are brightly colored, with patches of red or yellow on the wings or head, or white heads or breasts. They are highly social and are rarely found on their own, although the heavy-bodied, fruit-eating Striated laughingthrush is often seen in pairs only. Their behavior is similar to that of the larger babblers, but White-throated laughingthrushes may occur in single-species flocks of up to 100 birds. Being in the midst of one of these flocks is a remarkable experience; a wide variety of ringing calls emerge from bushes and trees all around, often with little sign of the birds themselves, which are surprisingly cryptic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The spectacular White-crested laughingthrush performs a remarkable communal display in which several members take part. The birds prance together on the forest floor, flapping their wings, with their white crests raised like helmets, and utter a series of hoarse, laughing calls that gradually mount to a crescendo. At dawn and dusk these calls are normally answered by neighboring groups, producing a chorus of choruses that echo among the densely forested hills where the birds live.
		</p>

		<h2>Cooperative Breeding in Babblers</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most striking characteristics of babbler behavior is the birds' tendency to occur in small, compact groups. These are not temporary groupings but permanent coalitions, usually forming an extended family, that remain together throughout the birds' lives and that cooperate in defense of a common territory.
		</p>
		<p>
			What has brought about this widespread cooperation? Being poor fliers, babblers tend to remain close to where they were born; considering the large number of species involved, they are remarkable in being wholly nonmigratory. A few of the high-altitude species move small distances between their summer and winter altitude zones, but usually no more than a few kilometers at most. This sedentary behavior makes it easier for groups to defend a year-round territory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because babbler groups defend territories year-round, there is no annual competition for space, and it is more difficult for new territories to become established. A young bird that remains with its parents until its abilities are fully developed, perhaps after several years, will stand a better chance of reproducing eventually than one that disperses immediately. In this situation, it is easy for cooperative behavior, such as communal rearing of the nestlings, to evolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to form a new territory in the face of strong competition, it may be necessary for several birds to collaborate. This is best achieved by groups of siblings; as they share many of the same genes, help given to other group members may benefit the survival of their own.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Jungle babbler, for example, groups of sibling males or females sometimes split off from their parental group and roam about in marginal areas. If they encounter a similar coalition of the opposite sex, originating from another group, then they may combine to try to establish a new territory. Alternatively, single females may try to join unrelated groups and sometimes succeed, despite opposition from the dominant female. Sibling and parent–offspring mating have not been recorded and breeding between unrelated individuals seems to be the rule, so some interchange between groups is essential.
		</p>
		<p>
			The importance of kin associations in setting up new territories provides another incentive for birds to remain in their parental group until they can form a coalition of sufficient strength to attempt to defend their own ground. It also gives some incentive for nonbreeders to assist in rearing younger siblings, as these may eventually help them in establishing a new territory.
