		<h1>Cuckoo Roller</h1>
		<p>
			Distinctive and unusual, the courol or Cuckoo roller lives only on Madagascar and the Comoros. In a region with many extraordinary life-forms, this bird is unique mainly for its specialized diet. It is more closely related to the “true” rollers than to the Madagascan ground-rollers.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Female cuckoo rollers with their reddish upperparts and spotted underparts look faintly like female cuckoos, which is among the reasons why the species got its common name when first described to science 200 years ago. The cuckoo roller's foot is zygodactylous, with two toes forward and two backward, as in cuckoos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only recently have details of cuckoo rollers' lives become quite well-known, and it is entirely coincidental that they, like cuckoos, eat hairy caterpillars. Feathers of the lores curl forward, then backward, in an “S” shape, not quite concealing the base of the bill. The body feathers have long aftershafts, and the whole plumage has a grayish bloom, perhaps related to the bird's two powderdown patches (downy spots filled with a talc-like powder), one on each side of the rump. The adaptive function of these patches is not known.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Cuckoo rollers generally hunt by perching motionless in the forest canopy, then, when prey is spotted, make a short, sallying flight into leaves, onto a trunk or branch, or into the air. Sometimes stomachs of the birds are lined with the fur of the hairy caterpillars they eat.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Only two nests and breeding attempts have been described in any detail. Nesting starts in September in the Comoros and November in Madagascar. Eggs are incubated for at least 20 days. Nestlings are covered in long, whitish down, and take some 30 days to fledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cuckoo rollers live in pairs and are remarkably tame. On Madagascar they can live in small patches of forest and are not threatened, but on Grand Comoro there are only about 100 pairs left and conservation measures are urgently needed.
