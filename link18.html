		<h1>Cardinal Grosbeak</h1>
		<p>
			Within the ranks of the cardinal grosbeaks are to be found several familiar birds that occur in suburban gardens in temperate North America, as well as some little-known species that inhabit tropical rain forests. In all, 10 species occur in the USA, some extending their range as far north as southern Canada. A particular favorite is the crested Northern cardinal, a resident of the eastern USA that sports his warm red plumage amid winter's snow. His mate is much duller.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks largely to people who provide seeds in winter, the cardinal has extended its breeding range over the last century from the Ohio Valley to north of the Great Lakes in southern Canada. In the southwestern USA and much of Mexico, it coexists with the equally high-crested and thick-billed pyrrhuloxia, more gray than red. A third species with a rosy red crest, the Vermilion cardinal, lives in the desert scrub along the Caribbean coast of northeastern Colombia and Venezuela. The males also have a rose-colored tail and wings; the females share the rosy crest, but otherwise are mostly sandy-brown.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The six or seven species of buntings of the genus Passerina, which live chiefly in the USA and Mexico, are among the most colorful of songbirds. One of the most elegant, the Painted bunting, has a blue head, a yellow-green mantle, a red rump and underparts, and dark wings and tail. The almost solid-blue male Indigo bunting, which nests in bushy places through much of the eastern half of the USA, wears a brownish dress much like the female's in its winter home in southern Mexico and Central America. In the American west, the Lazuli bunting replaces the Indigo bunting. The male has a turquoise-blue head and back, with a cinnamon-colored breast, white belly, and two white wing-bars. The female is much like the female Indigo bunting in color, but has two faint wing-bars. The ranges of the Lazuli and Indigo buntings overlap on the Great Plains of the US Midwest, and the two species hybridize.
		</p>
		<p>
			In southwestern Mexico the Orange-breasted bunting is locally common. The male has a green cap with a turquoise-blue head and back, and golden-orange throat and belly. The female is lime green above with yellow underparts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Rose-breasted grosbeak is another migratory species. After nesting in open woodlands and similar habitats in the northeastern USA and southern Canada, the birds fly off to spend the colder months as far away as Venezuela and Peru. In their winter plumage, the males retain enough red on their breasts to distinguish them from the browner-colored females.
		</p>
		<p>
			The closely-related Yellow grosbeak is a resident of Mexico; most populations are not migratory. The males are bright yellow, with black wings that are spotted with white; the females are duller yellow, with streaks on the crown and back, and olive rather than black wings. They are often found in pairs or small groups, typically feeding rather high in fruiting trees.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dickcissel, which sings its name in open fields chiefly in the Mississippi Valley region and which winters in vast numbers as far south as Venezuela and Trinidad, sometimes causes heavy losses where rice is grown. Dickcissels are at present declining in numbers, perhaps in part because they are persecuted in South America as agricultural pests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among the nonmigratory tropical members of this subfamily are the Blue-black grosbeak and his brown mate, both of which sing beautifully in the rain forests and bushy clearings of southern Mexico and Central America. They eat corn (maize), but are not gregarious, and consequently do only slight damage to crops. The closely-related Ultramarine grosbeak is found in semi-arid scrub in northern South America, as well as in dense thickets and woodland edge farther to the southeast. Like Blue-black grosbeaks, the males are dark blue, the females dark brown above and paler brown below. The smaller Glaucous-blue grosbeak of southern Brazil and Uruguay is similar in color. All of these “blue” grosbeaks are shy and retiring birds, but they will sometimes sing from a conspicuous perch on the top of a bush.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Slate-colored grosbeak is more closely confined to mid and upper levels of rain forests, where its bluish-gray plumage, almost uniformly dark, contrasts with a heavy, bright-red bill. The female is similar in color, but slightly paler and a more olivaceous gray. The birds are usually found in pairs, and often join mixed-species flocks. The male Crimson-collared grosbeak of northwestern Mexico has a dull, pinkish-red collar and breast, with a black hood and dark wings. The female is similar in color, but dull olive-green where the male is pinkish-red. A few of the birds wander north to the lower Rio Grande Valley in winter.
		</p>
		<p>
			The smaller species – the Little, Savile's, Buff-crested, and Red-crested bustards – have relatively short legs and necks. These, and most of the Eupodotis bustards, fly with rapid wingbeats; the larger species use slow, deep, powerful beats, but fly deceptively fast. On the ground, bustards are strong but usually slow walkers, characteristically nervous and alert: they move into cover at the first sign of danger, or freeze into a flattened posture and rely on their cryptic plumage for camouflage.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Most cardinal grosbeaks consume soft fruits, flower buds, and insects as well as weed seeds and grains. The pyrrhuloxia of Mexico and the US Southwest uses its strong, parrotlike beak to crush the beans of the spiny mesquite brush (Prosopis spp.) common in the region. The 15 or so saltator species, like tanagers, show a preference for fruits. Most saltators, which inhabit semi-open and scrub country through much of tropical America, are rather large and fairly plain grosbeaks, often with white eyebrows; unusually for grosbeaks, both genders are similar in color. The widespread Buff-throated saltator is a frequent attendant at feeders where bananas are offered. When eating, these birds and some of their relatives rest a fruit precariously on a horizontal branch while they bite off pieces.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The social habits of cardinal grosbeaks vary greatly. Solitary and pugnacious in the breeding season, the lovely male Painted buntings may occasionally wound and even kill their adversaries. At the other extreme Yellow-green grosbeaks, which travel at all seasons through rain forests and shady clearings in loose flocks, display no territorial exclusiveness. Parents feeding nestlings are joined by one or more helpers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The female usually builds the cup-shaped nest, but male cardinals and Blue-black grosbeaks share the task. Although in most species only the female incubates, male Rose-breasted and Black-headed grosbeaks take turns on the eggs, often singing while they sit. Male cardinals, Buff-throated saltators, and Blue-black grosbeaks bring food to their incubating partners. In most species the father helps feed the young, but male Painted buntings are unreliable attendants, and the polygamous male dickcissel neglects his offspring.
