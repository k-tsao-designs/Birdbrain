		<h1>Comorant</h1>
		<p>
			Deriving their name from the latin term corvus marinus (“sea raven”), cormorants are highly adapted for underwater hunting. Their bodies are streamlined and somewhat flattened beneath, the neck is long and supple, the wings broad, long, and blunt, and the legs powerful and set far back. Using their lean bodies, they thrust through the water and along the seabed to flush out prey. They range in size from the Pygmy to the goose-sized Great cormorant; the heaviest is the flightless Galápagos cormorant.
		</p>
		<p>
			Twenty-nine of the 39 or so species are entirely (or almost entirely) marine; four are freshwater residents, and six are at home in inshore waters, estuaries, or inland. They nest on shores, spray-swept rocks, islands, cliffs, trees, bushes, and in reed beds. They can forage in manmade ditches in the tropics and in the icy stormy seas of the Antarctic. Only the open seas are barred to the birds.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Cormorants have large webbed feet that produce powerful stern propulsion but are also flexible enough to allow some species to nest and roost in trees. The bill is typically long and sharply hooked; the edges of the mandibles are not toothed. The sides of the mouth and throat are hugely distensible, allowing cormorants to swallow large prey. The shape of the eye lens is highly modifiable, for improved vision underwater.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like pelicans, cormorants have broad breast bones without the deep keels found in birds with powerful flight muscles. In the Double-crested cormorant, for instance, these muscles weigh only about half as much, as a percentage of body weight, as in birds with strong flapping flight. The birds typically fly low over the water with the neck extended, employing continuous wingbeats. Cormorant bones are much denser than, for example, those of pelicans. Together with a notable absence of body fat, this feature helps to reduce buoyancy, and so facilitates underwater pursuit of prey. The birds swim low in the water or partly submerged. Underwater, they steer with their webs and tail, keeping their wings close to their sides
		</p>
		<p>
			Although most cormorants are black, often with an iridescent sheen, many species display striking nuptial adornments of crests and filoplumes, together with garishly colored facial skin, gapes, and orbital rings (the ring around the eye). Juveniles are drab brown and white. Like some boobies, certain cormorants exhibit genuine color morphs within the same population.
		</p>
		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Cormorants are widespread along most coastlines and on many inland waters. They breed from well north of the Bering Strait south into the Antarctic and around the globe. Marine species are confined to inshore waters, and most oceanic islands lack them; they are also absent from northern regions of central Asia and from arid continental wastelands. The Australasian region supports the greatest number of species, but the greatest concentrations occur in food-rich inshore waters such as the Humboldt, Benguela, and California Current areas and cool, temperate areas of the sub-Arctic and Antarctic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The least specialized species, such as the Great cormorant, have the widest distribution. By contrast, several of the Antarctic shags are confined to specific small islands and their populations are extremely small (in one extreme case, just a few hundreds). The only flightless cormorant, found on the Galápagos island of Fernandina, numbers just 700–800 pairs, whereas in contrast there are many millions of guanays in Peru. The world population of the common and widespread Great cormorant is impossible to compute.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			All cormorants pursue prey underwater, using only foot propulsion. They have a large volume of blood in proportion to body weight, and the stored oxygen enables some species to remain submerged for up to four minutes. The ratio of dive duration to time spent on the surface is complex. Diving speed is about 0.69–1.01m/sec (2.3–3.3ft/sec). No cormorant forages far out at sea, but flights from the breeding colony to feeding locations may stretch to scores of kilometers. Often two or three cormorant species overlap, but species-typical differences in feeding habits involving depth, bottom feeding, and other factors tend to reduce competition, although there is considerable overlap in the prey species taken. Precisely what type of prey cormorants take has been determined by studying their mucus-coated pellets, which contain the hard parts of prey and other regurgitates. Although they mainly subsist on a wide variety of fish, cormorants also take amphibia, crustacea, cephalopods, and other invertebrates. Communal and probably cooperative feeding occurs; the extreme example of the former is the vast feeding flocks of guanays off Peru.
		</p>
		<p>
			Calculations of daily energy expenditure suggest that wild Great cormorants need to eat more than 500g (18oz) of food per day. Cormorants are such efficient hunters that the daily requirements can be met in two fairly short fishing periods. Because their plumage is not waterproof, the periods are generally short, in most cases lasting little more than 30 minutes.
		</p>
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			All cormorants are colonial, although, with a few notable exceptions, the breeding colonies are small. Colonies are of two kinds – large, dense aggregations in superproductive upwelling areas which, because they bring nutrients from deeper layers of the sea, are rich in plankton and therefore in fish, or, more typically, small groups of tens or hundreds. Colonies persist from year to year, especially on small islands, although some species may from time to time shift sites several kilometers. An individual colony of guanays may hold millions of birds, packed so densely that they look like the pile on a carpet. They return from feeding in dense ropes and skeins many kilometers long, and fill the air with a deafening gabble.
		</p>
		<p>
			In aseasonal colonies breeding may be almost continuous, as in the Galápagos cormorant, whereas in high latitudes it is confined to a short summer period. Some cormorants breed opportunistically, regardless of season. Breeding cycles are very much shorter than those of boobies and, especially, frigatebirds. Chicks take only 5–9 weeks to fledge, and the post-fledging feeding period typically lasts for about a month, although it is much longer in a few species. A representative cormorant breeding cycle occupies 19–20 weeks.
		</p>
		<p>
			In seasonal climates, cormorants breed successfully no more than once a year. However the Galápagos cormorant can breed more often by abandoning the fledgling to the male's care while the female embarks on a new cycle with another partner. Bank cormorants and guanays sometimes manage two broods a year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cormorants tend to start breeding when comparatively young. This behavior, along with large broods, rapid growth, and a relatively short life, is part of a cluster of adaptations related to the birds' inshore feeding habits that contrasts with an opposite cluster in far-foraging, pelagic seabirds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even where a colony endures from year to year, cormorants (unlike gannets) are not faithful to a particular nest site, except, occasionally, in the case of species such as the Antarctic shag, in which a durable pedestal remains. Competition for sites may involve brief bill-grappling or seizing the opponent by the neck or a wing, but fights are usually superficial, escalating out of threat behavior (which involves staring, pointing, gaping, and thrusting). Males growl or bark raucously, while females hiss and click. Nest material is seized and quivered in a form of redirected aggression, and the substrate is attacked in lieu of an opponent.
		<p>
		</p>
			Usually, cormorants change mates for successive breeding attempts. Pairs form in response to a complex advertising display from the male, usually from a potential nest-site. There are strong generic similarities in the display, although each of its various components is modified according to species. Special plumage features, such as head plumes and white thigh patches, develop before the onset of courtship and serve to emphasize the display; for example, wing-flicking may alternately cover and expose the white thigh patch. Another component, in which the head is thrown right back, in some species until the crown rests on the base of the tail, is common to most cormorants. Further displays accompany changeover on the eggs. Before egg laying, there may be copulations involving partners other than the mate. DNA analysis has revealed that, in the European shag, up to 18 percent of chicks result from a female mating with a bird other than her mate.
		</p>

		<h2>Conservation and Environment</h2>
		<p>
			Many species of cormorant are hated by fishermen because they take prey that humans value, such as salmon smolts. They also prey on fish reared by fish-farmers, especially catfish in the Mississippi area of the United States. Consequently, cormorants, especially the Great and Double-crested cormorants, are subject to often intense persecution by humans. Even rare Antarctic endemics are sometimes killed. However, most cormorants are not endangered.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since at least the 5th century in Japan and the early 17th century in Europe, cormorants have been used for sport and commercial fishing. This kind of fishing has been described as an ancient form of aquatic falconry. Teams of birds, tethered to a line and with neck collars that prevent them from swallowing the fish, are released, hauled in, and their catch removed. Eventually the birds are permitted to eat some of the fish; if not, it is said, they soon go on strike.
