		<h1>Diving Petrel</h1>
		<p>
			One of the amazing sights of the southern seas is that of a small flock of diving petrels flying through a steep wave, plunging in one side and coming out the other, or else erupting unchecked from the ocean. This behavior is possible thanks to the adaptation of the birds' wings for swimming underwater.
		</p>
		<p>
			Diving petrels are in fact a southern equivalent of the auks of northern seas; in particular they resemble the Little auk, sharing its whirring, “bumblebee” flight and small wings, adapted for swimming underwater. The structure of the wing bones is remarkably similar in both groups, while another resemblance lies in the fact that the Peruvian diving petrel, like several auk species, becomes flightless during wing molt. The petrel's stomach commonly remains full of food at that time, however, indicating that it can continue to forage efficiently even when “grounded.”

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The four species of diving petrels are very similar in size and plumage, which makes identification difficult unless the bird is in the hand and the variable amounts of gray or white on the upper side can be seen. Only the Magellan diving petrel, with its white collar, has a distinctive plumage. It also has a distinguishable juvenile, which lacks the white fringes on feathers on the back common to the other species. Also distinctive but only visible from close to are the so-called paraseptal processes that partition the nostrils and are thought to prevent the entry of seawater.
		</p>
		<p>
			Diving petrels chase their prey by swimming underwater. They feed mainly within the upper 10m (33ft) of the ocean, although on occasion they can dive as deep as 60m (200ft). Their diet consists of small marine organisms. The most detailed analysis of diet has been conducted on Common and Georgian diving petrels at South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands. In both locations, the two species were found to eat mostly crustacea; but while Georgian diving petrels fed their chicks predominantly on euphausiid krill, Common diving petrels, feeding closer inshore but at greater depths, usually delivered copepods and amphipods.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Distribution</h2>
		<p>
			Colonies of diving petrels can be extensive; there are an estimated two million breeding pairs of Georgian diving petrels on South Georgia and in excess of one million on the Crozets and Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. These three sites are also the strongholds of the Common diving petrel, the most widespread of the four species. For both species, the most significant current threat is that of predation by rats introduced to the islands.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only four breeding sites – two in Peru and two in Chile – are known for the Peruvian diving petrel, which nests under boulders and is now classified as Endangered. Many former sites were destroyed by commercial extraction of guano (excrement), in which the bird used to excavate its burrows.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although common in the fjord region of southern Chile and on the coast of southern Argentina, the Magellanic diving petrel is a very poorly known species that appears to nest in peaty soil.
		</p>
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Breeding is confined to cool waters north of 60° south and up the western coast of South America, where the sea temperature is influenced by the cool Humboldt Current. Unlike many other petrels, diving petrels do not appear to travel far, even outside the breeding season; they are usually seen near the breeding area, in waters over the continental shelf.
		</p>
		<p>
			The breeding sequence has been described in detail for Georgian and Common diving petrels on South Georgia. The birds nest in burrows that are re-excavated each season, flying in at night, presumably to avoid attracting the attention of skuas to the colonies. The Georgian species tunnels into bare, stony soil above the vegetation level, whereas Common diving petrels nest at lower levels in peaty, often waterlogged soil beneath stands of tussock grass. The birds call at night; the Georgian diving petrel makes a series of harsh squeaks, while the Common diving petrel utters a two-syllable phrase rendered as “kuaka,” the Maori name for the species.
		</p>
		<p>
			While calling may be essential for attracting a mate, it can have the less desirable side-effect of attracting predators. One way of making it harder for a call to be located is to introduce noise, in the technical sense of a scrambled multi-frequency signal. It is therefore both logical and fascinating that the calls uttered by Georgian diving petrels on the ground, where they are vulnerable to attack, include just such a scrambled element. The noise disappears when the calls are given in flight, where the birds are not at risk of being attacked by skuas.
