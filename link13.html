		<h1>Bowerbird</h1>
		<p>
			Many ornithologists see bowerbirds as by far the most behaviorally complex and intriguing of all birds. Not only do the males of many species construct elaborate structures that they decorate with variable and often colorful objects – fruits, berries, fungi, tinfoil, bits of plastic – but some actually paint them with natural pigments, applied with the aid of a “paintbrush” held in the bill.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bowerbirds are stout, strong-footed, typically heavy-billed birds; their sizes range from that of a starling to a small crow. The family comprises three species of socially monogamous and territorial catbirds and 17 species that are known or presumed to reproduce polygynously. The males of the polygynous species are responsible for bower-building, an activity that has earned them a longstanding popular reputation for high intelligence and esthetic sensibility. Indeed, it has recently been proved that they have relatively larger brains than ecologically similar songbirds of their size and zoogeographical region, and that the bower-building species have larger brains than the non-bower-building ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			So architecturally complex and “tastefully” decorated can bowers be that early Europeans refused to believe that birds had built them; instead, they chose to believe that they were made by human mothers to entertain their children. New Guinean men admire the male birds for their industry and artistry in acquiring and displaying what they consider the birds' equivalent of the “brideprice” they themselves offer for wives. The bowers in fact have nothing to do with nesting, which is entirely the concern of females.
		</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The largest bowerbird is the Great and the smallest the Golden, the latter being 30–40 percent lighter and smaller than the former. Males are typically heavier and larger in most body measurements than conspecific females, notable exceptions being the female Golden and Sericulus bowerbirds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The family exhibits 50–60 different plumages, given that most of the 20 species have a juvenile and an adult male and female (and in some cases a subadult male) plumage. The monogamous catbirds are sexually monochromatic, but the polygynous genera are typically sexually dichromatic to varying degrees. The catbird sexes are similar, being generally green with white spotting on the breast, wings, and tail, and about the head and/or throat. Sexes of the polygynous Tooth-billed bowerbird are also identical, being olive-brown above and heavily streaked brown on dirty white below. Males of the other forest-dwelling polygynous species are brightly colored; glimmering gold, or orange, and black, as in the Flame, Adelbert, Regent, and Archbold's bowerbirds; iridescent blue-black in the well known Satin; brilliant yellow and golden-olive in the Golden; or generally brown, with a contrasting orange or yellow crest, as in most of the Amblyornis species. The Spotted, Great, Fawn-breasted, and Lauterbach's bowerbirds of grasslands and more arid woodlands are generally drab gray or brownish, with small, pinkish nape crests. Females of the promiscuous species wear drab, cryptically colored and marked plumage, being predominantly brown, olive, or gray, often with barring or spotting. Juvenile and immature plumages are generally similar to those of adult females.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once adult, bowerbirds have a high average life expectancy, some individuals living for 20–30 years. Males of polygynously reproducing species take up to seven years to attain adult plumage. Bowerbirds are exceptional in having 11–14 secondaries (including the tertials), unlike typical songbirds, which have 9–10, while their enlarged lachrymal (part of the skull cranium, near the orbit) is paralleled only in the Australian lyrebirds (Menuridae).
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Most bowerbirds are predominantly fruit-eaters, but flowers, nectar, leaves, arthropods (mostly insects), and other animals including small vertebrates are taken. Figs are a major component of Australian catbird diets. Animal foods are important to nestlings of polygynous species, which tend to be fed one particular kind of animal (cicadas, beetles, skinks, or grasshoppers) by their mothers. Unlike birds of paradise, bowerbirds do not use their feet to hold or manipulate food or other items, and do not regurgitate food to nestlings. Catbirds store, or cache, fruits about their territories, and the males of some polygynous species do so about their bower sites.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The courts or bowers that males (catbirds excepted) clear, build, and decorate are created to impress females and, possibly, to intimidate rival males. Males of bower-tending species are promiscuous, attracting as many females as possible to their bower by calls and/or colorful plumage. The bowers are critical to male reproductive success. Discerning females assess the frequency and intensity of male vocalizations and bower attendance, the quality and/or quantity of the bowers themselves and their decorations, and also the males' displays and plumage, before soliciting the male of their choice. It is the older males that are typically selected by females and are most likely to be successful in obtaining multiple matings. Importantly, males of the more colorful species build modest bowers, while the drabber ones construct the largest and most complex structures (see The Transferal Effect).
		</p>
		<p>
			The bowers are located in favored spots exhibiting one or more required micro-environmental features. Until recently, promiscuous male bowerbirds were presumed to form breeding colonies or leks, their bowers being clustered in associated congregations, but this behavior has not been confirmed except for the tooth-bill. Male tooth-bills clear a forest floor “court” area of litter and lay green leaves on it, with the paler side uppermost; they then call almost continuously to attract females to the site. Their courts appear to be unevenly dispersed through suitable habitat to form denser aggregations that serve as leks. In contrast, studies of Regent, Satin, Fawn-breasted, Macgregor's, Archbold's, and Golden bowerbirds suggest that they do not form leks, their bowers being evenly distributed. Spotted bowerbirds may even form leks of a kind in some areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bower sites are occupied for decades, and adult males exhibit longterm fidelity to them. Some Satin bowerbird sites have been used for up to 50 years. Immature males serve an “apprenticeship” of 5–6 years, visiting the bowers of other males and constructing rudimentary or “practice” bowers of their own while polishing their skills. Adequate bower-building is not innate but, to judge at least from Satin bowerbirds, is largely learned.
		</p>
		<p>
			In those bower-building species that have been studied, females defend only their nest site, while males defend only the bower and its immediate vicinity. A single female may use a nest location over consecutive years. The nest itself typically consists of a stick foundation under a cup of dried leaves and twigs that is discretely lined with tendrils and similar finer materials. In Macgregor's and Golden bowerbirds, the nests are set on average 2m (6.5ft) above the ground, a figure that rises to 15m (50ft) in Satin bowerbirds and tooth-bills.
		</p>
		<p>
			The elliptical eggs are either pale and unmarked or else colored and vermiculated. Clutch size is 1–3 eggs for both monogamous and polygynous species (with a higher average clutch size in Australia than in New Guinea). Unlike in most songbirds, eggs are laid on alternate days. Incubation periods span 21–27 days, and in both uni- and biparental species the birds spend on average 70 percent of the daylight hours incubating. Nestling periods span 17–30 days, brooding constancy averaging 31–36 percent of daylight in Australian catbirds and 16–30 percent in polygynous species. There is no evidence of two broods being successfully raised in a single season. Offspring have a long period of post-nest parental dependency.
		</p>
		<p>
			The socially monogamous catbirds defend an all-purpose territory year-round, and pairs remain together over several seasons, if not for life. Male catbirds do not build nests, incubate the eggs, or brood nestlings, although they do feed them.
		</p>
		<h2>Transference Effect</h2>
		<p>
			In bowerbirds, the gaudy display plumage of promiscuous males is said to be “transferred” to the bower displays. There are various conspicuous stages of this transfer across species: birds that have retained colorful adult male plumage build small, sparse, and dully decorated bowers, whereas the most elaborate and decorated bowers are built by duller males.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three basic bower types. First is the “court” of the Tooth-billed bowerbird – not a structure but a cleared area of forest floor decorated with leaves. Second are the “maypole” bowers of the Golden, Archbold's, and the Amblyornis bowerbirds; this latter New Guinea group were once known as “gardeners” because of the meticulous arrangements of decorations they place upon a manicured, lawnlike “mat” of moss. Maypole bowers typically consist of accumulations of woody sticks and twigs placed about the vertical trunks of sapling trees or tree ferns. Three maypole builders build complex bowers that look like small towers or thatched buildings, with a neat basal moss mat decorated with colorful flowers, fruits, beetle wing-cases (elytra), tree resin, fungi, insect castings, and other objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			The transferal effect is clearly demonstrated by certain Amblyornis species and their maypole bowers, which vary from the simple stick tower of Macgregor's 1 to the complex, hutlike structure of the Vogelkop bowerbird 2. Macgregor's, which has a large orange crest, builds the simplest bower. The Streaked has a reduced crest but a more complex bower 3, while the Vogelkop bowerbird, the most sophisticated builder of all, completely lacks a crest.
		</p>
		<p>
			The relationship between the relative luxuriance of the birds' crests and their bowers was first noticed in the 1960s, when the bower of the splendidly crested Yellow-fronted was still undiscovered. The transferal effect theory suggested that the bower would be simple in design. And, when they were subsequently found in remote Irian Jaya, they did indeed resemble the plain stick towers of Macgregor's bowerbird.
		</p>
		<p>
			The third bower type are the “avenue” bowers of Sericulus, Ptilonorhynchus, and Chlamydera species: Those of the Flame, Satin 4, and Spotted bowerbirds feature two parallel stick walls that form a central avenue. Here too there is clear evidence of transfer, with the crestless species building more complex and ornately decorated bowers than the crested ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sexual selection through female choice has apparently caused this transference of colorful visual signals from the crest of adult males to their bowers. Females select males with superior bowers and thus enhance bower architecture, because males that make such bowers reproduce far more often than those that do not. Once such a transfer of secondary sexual characters to the bower was underway, bright plumage would have become an active disadvantage, attracting predators to the bower where the males spend much of their time.
