		<h1>Cassowary</h1>
		<p>
			There is something of the mystery of the jungle about the cassowaries. Many people have seen their footprints and their feces or even heard them call, but glimpses of the birds are rare. For the largest land animals in New Guinea, they have kept their secrets well; little is known of their life history.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			All three species have sleek, drooping, brown or black plumage. Their wing quills are enlarged, spikelike structures, used in fighting and defense. The three toes on their feet are also effective weapons, the inner toe being armed with a long, sharp claw: the kick of a cassowary has disemboweled many adversaries. In all species the legs and neck are long, and the head is adorned with a casque (higher in the female than the male). The casque is not horny, but composed of trabecular bone or calcified cartilage, covered with a keratinous skin. Its core is fused firmly with the skull. The neck is ornamented with colorful bare skin and small, fleshy flaps (wattles). The sexes are alike. In chicks the plumage is striped chestnut brown, black, and white, changing to a uniform brown for the first year of life. The glossy black adult plumage begins to grow during the second year and is fully developed at 4 years. The casque on the head is often thought to be used by the birds to push through the thick jungle. A captive bird was observed using it to turn over soil as it sought food, so perhaps wild cassowaries also use the casque to turn over the leaf litter, searching for small animals, fallen fruit, and fungi.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cassowaries are essentially solitary animals, forming pairs in the breeding season but at other times living alone. The male incubates the 4–8 eggs in a nest on the forest floor. He accompanies the chicks for about a year before returning to his solitary life. The bird's most commonly-heard call is a deep “chug chug,” but during courtship the male Southern cassowary approaches the female uttering a low “boo-boo-boo” call, circling her and causing his throat to swell and tremble. Cassowaries are pugnacious, and most contacts between wild individuals observed outside the breeding season culminated in fights. It is assumed from their distribution that individuals, at least of the Southern cassowary, are territorial.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Cassowaries feed mainly on the fruit of forest trees, which they eat whole. The fruits of laurels, myrtles, palms, and Elaeocarpus are most important for the Southern cassowary. As the fruit of these trees grows high in the canopy and the cassowaries cannot fly, they are dependent on finding fallen fruit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike the other two species, which live exclusively in rainforest jungle, the moruk also has sparse populations in several mountainous parts of New Guinea. In these locations it apparently feeds on those shrubs and heathland plants from which it can take fruits directly. All species will also feed on insects, invertebrates, small vertebrates, and some fungi.
		</p>

		<h2>Conservation and Environment</h2>
		<p>
			Cassowaries need a supply of fruit throughout the year, so only large forests with a good diversity of tree species will sustain a population. Studies of the Southern cassowary on Cape York showed that it ate the fruits of 75 species, as well as fungi and land snails. Breeding (in winter) coincided with the period when the maximum amount of fruit was available in the forest. The survival of the cassowaries may therefore depend upon the survival of diverse forests where it is possible for them to obtain food throughout the year. Many forests used for timber production no longer retain their primitive diversity, so in a slow and subtle way they are growing less capable of supporting cassowaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			Individuals of all three species are kept in captivity by the peoples of New Guinea. The birds' plumes are plucked and used to decorate headdresses, the quills are used as nose ornaments, and the whole animal is finally butchered for a feast.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cassowaries have been traded throughout Southeast Asia for at least 500 years. When sugar plantations were developed in the late 19th century, cassowary populations were much reduced. The populations of the Southern cassowary on Ceram and of the moruk on New Britain probably arose from the breeding of escaped captives, brought from the main island of New Guinea.
