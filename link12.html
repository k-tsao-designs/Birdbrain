		<h1>Bird of Paradise</h1>
		<p>
			Birds of paradise – or at least the magnificently plumed adult males, such as the Black sicklebill with its sabre-like central tail feathers 1m (3.3ft) long – are considered by many to be the most ornate and beautiful of all birds. They are typically highly animated and vocal, crow- or starling-like, strong-footed birds, with species that range from sexually and cryptically monochromatic to dramatically dichromatic. The family includes birds with both monogamous and polygynous mating systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Birds of paradise are so named because the first specimens of the adult males to reach the Western world consisted of empty, legless skins prepared by Papuans for the plume trade (an important business in and around New Guinea for thousands of years). This led naturalists of the 16th century to conclude that, lacking a stomach and feet, these beautiful creatures must float in the airs of “paradise,” falling to earth only upon death.
		</p>
		<p>
			The birds have served as a focus of myth, ceremony, personal adornment, and dance for the peoples of New Guinea and neighboring islands for tens of thousands of years. No other avian family exhibits the diversity of feather structure and color found in the Paradisaeidae, particularly males of the polygynous species. Their spectacular and ornate plumages, which serve to impress females choosing a partner, represent an extreme expression of the processes of sexual selection.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Monogamous species are sexually monochromatic, and the polygynous ones typically sexually dichromatic from a slight to an extreme degree. The five uniformly blue-black manucodes (Manucodia spp.), the similarly dully plumaged paradise-crow, and the generally black Macgregor's bird of paradise show no sexual differences in plumage and are thought to be monogamous. The two sexually monochromatic species of paradigalla were also presumed to be monogamous, but one is now known to breed polygynously. The other more colorful and sexually dichromatic species appear to be polygynous.
		</p>
		<p>
			Male plumages of polygynous species (in which males mate with more than one female during a breeding season) are extremely varied, from black with brilliant areas of metallic iridescence to brilliant combinations of yellows, reds, blues, and browns, with rich pastel areas of specialized display plumes or weird head or tail “wires” of modified feathering. Each genus of the polygynously reproducing species has a basic male plumage structure peculiar to itself that is manipulated in certain ways during courtship displays in order to best present it to potential mates. Several species exhibit colorful areas of pigmented bare skin (head, wattles, legs, feet) that, because they tend to be much brighter in males than in females, may relate to courtship while also acting as species-specific social signals. In adult males of several genera, some outer primaries are modified in shape either slightly or highly, probably for the production of sound in flight. Females of known monogamous species have identifiable vocalizations, whereas among polygynous species all loudly-broadcast cries are male advertisement calls, while the females are virtually mute. Manucodes have an elongated, coiled trachea that is displaced to sit subcutaneously above the pectoral muscles; this produces low, far-carrying, tremulous call-notes that are unique within the group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Birds of paradise were long considered most closely related to bowerbirds, and some ornithologists joined the two groups in a single family, Paradisaeidae. As a result of exponentially increasing biological and molecular appreciation, however, it is now clear that the birds are most closely related to crows and other crow-like birds (the higher songbirds or passerines), while bowerbirds are relatively distant relations.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Birds of paradise are omnivorous, encompassing a diversity of diets that is unsurprisingly wide in view of their range of body sizes and bill morphologies. Bills vary from short, stout, and crow-like through to finer, starling-like beaks, to extremely long, decurved, and sickle-shaped tools used to probe under moss and bark and between otherwise inaccessible bases of tree fronds for arthropods, insect larvae, and other prey. While most species are predominantly fruit-eaters that also take a variety of arthropods, small vertebrates, leaves, and buds, the sicklebills and riflebirds are highly specialized insectivores that eat relatively little fruit. In the latter, longer-billed species, the bill of adult females is for the most part larger than that of adult males. This fact is noteworthy, as many birds of paradise have to cope with limited resources during nonbreeding months. At such times sexual differences in bill size may significantly reduce intersexual competition for limited arthropod populations, because each sex would take differing species or sizes of prey accordingly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Typical birds of paradise use their feet to hold and manipulate food items (something bowerbirds do not do). Parents regurgitate food to their offspring (also unlike bowerbirds). They initially feed nestlings on arthropods, but then switch to mostly fruit or a mix of fruit and arthropods.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			The various bird of paradise genera display a range of reproductive behavior, from pair-bonded monogamy to polygyny. Monogamous species exhibit a bond that appears to be year-round, the pair defending an all-purpose breeding territory and attending the nest and nestlings. The majority of species, however, have polygynous mating systems, with promiscuous males and exclusively female nest attendance. Females build nests, incubate, and raise offspring alone and unaided. Displays of promiscuous males range from solitary and non-territorial to communal, or lekking, mating systems, with a range of intermediate manifestations. Males may occupy a single courting site – either a terrestrial court or a tree perch or perches – or else an all-purpose territory that includes one or more such sites.
		</p>
		<p>
			The displays of promiscuous males are undertaken to impress females or, as in the Paradisaea species that congregate on leks (communal breeding grounds), to establish a male dominance hierarchy. Like many males, the six-wired parotias (Parotia spp.) display solitarily at courts or perches that are used by individuals down the generations year after year. Younger males wait the opportunity to occupy such traditional display sites, during which time they must, like young male bowerbirds, spend years (perhaps as many as seven) in immature, female-like plumage. With adult males mating with many females, there are few males in the breeding population relative to the combined numbers of immature males and females. Pressure by immature males as well as from rival adults ensures that only the fittest males are able to maintain a place in the breeding community and that only the most vigorous immatures come to inherit display sites. Interestingly, captive young male birds of paradise have bred at a relatively early age in the absence of adult-plumaged males, suggesting seasonal hormonal activity may be restricted by the presence of dominant adult males. No such inhibition affects females, which are capable of breeding when 2–3 years old.
		</p>
		<p>
			While a breeding system in which few males fertilize many females has brought about evolutionarily rapid divergence in the appearance of the various male Paradisaeidae species, they nonetheless remain genetically close. Thus, species markedly different in male appearance are not genetically isolated, and as a result hybrids occur where two species meet. In all, 13 intergeneric and seven intrageneric hybrid crosses are documented, occurring where species ranges and favored habitats overlap.
		</p>
		<p>
			It seems that the predominance of tropical forest fruits in the diet of some birds is important to the development of polygyny, and that the quality of fruit and/or its dispersion in space and time within the forest may dictate the kind of breeding system and the way in which males disperse and display. A seasonal hyperabundance of fruits permits promiscuous males to spend inordinate amounts of time at display sites, and enables females to nest and tend to their young unaided, while their spatial/temporal dispersion makes an all-purpose territory economically undefendable.
