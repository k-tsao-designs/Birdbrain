		<h1>Australo-Papuan Robin</h1>
		<p>
			Although called “robins,” the members of this family are in no way related to the true robins (Turdidae) of the USA or Europe. They are, however, considered convergently similar, with some species (notably Monachella and Microeca) resembling Old World flycatchers, others (Drymodes and Amalocichla) recalling the true thrushes, and the rest resembling Old World robins.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Throughout their range, the Eopsaltridae have evolved to occupy a wide range of niches, from the dry, open, savanna regions of Australia (for example, the jacky-winter) and the banks of fast-flowing streams (the Torrent robin) to the montane forests and alpine shrubberies of New Guinea (the Alpine robin). Throughout these habitats, most species occupy the lower stratum of the vegetation where they forage. A large number of species are perch-and-pounce insectivores, often remaining motionless on horizontal branches, rocks, or logs before pouncing onto the ground or trunks of trees for arthropod prey. Microeca species also hawk for flying insects from perches.
		</p>
		<p>
			The plumage of the Eopsaltridae varies, with the majority of species (for example, those in the genera Microeca, Eopsaltria, Poecilodryas, and Tregellasia) being olive-green to olive-brown with yellow. Both Petroica and Eugerygone comprise red-breasted robins, although, interestingly, the species in these two genera are the only members of the Eopsaltridae to exhibit notable sexual dichromatism. A number of species have black and white plumage, while one species, the Blue-grey robin (Peneothello cyanus), exhibits the coloration its name indicates. Brown mottled plumage on a pale breast is a diagnostic characteristic of the juveniles of the Eopsaltridae.
		</p>
		<h2>Conservation: Saving the Black Robin</h2>
		<p>
			Many species of the Eopsaltridae, such as the New Guinea robins, have highly contracted distributions and are thus considered rare. As a result of clearing and modification of woodlands throughout southern Australia, two Hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) subspecies are classed as vulnerable or near threatened, with five species being of conservation concern due to their declining distribution and abundance.
		</p>
		<p>
			At one time the Eopsaltridae included one of the world's rarest birds, the Chatham Islands robin. The population on Chatham Island itself, southeast of New Zealand, was wiped out, and by 1976 only seven individuals remained on nearby Little Mangere Island. In 1979, all the surviving birds were transported to Mangere Island, where the population declined further to only five individuals, four males and one female, in 1981. Intensive management through cross-fostering and nest protection subsequently saw numbers increase, and by 1999 the population had reached 259. Accidental introduction of predators to their sanctuaries remains an ever-present danger; moreover, the limited gene-pool of the birds means that the whole population is at risk should disease strike. There are plans to move the growing population to the larger Pitt Island.
