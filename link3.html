		<h1>Asities</h1>
		<p>
			Endemic to madagascar, asities appear to be closely related to (and have recently been combined with) the broadbills of the family Eurylaeimidae, based on similarities of anatomy and nest structure. Male asities in breeding plumage develop fleshy wattles of a unique cellular structure around the eye; the only broadbill with a similar eye wattle occurs in the Philippines.

		<h2>Form and Function: Disparate Genera in a Single Family</h2>
		<p>
			The radically different bills and dissimilar plumages of the two asity genera illustrate the wide radiation that must have occurred within the broadbill family. It also suggests that intermediate forms, possibly more primitive and broadbill-like, may have existed on Madagascar in the past.
		</p>
		<p>
			Illustrations of the parallel development of false sunbirds (on Madagascar) and true sunbirds (in Africa and Asia) include not only the development of the tubular tongue and curved bill in both groups but also a biannual molt. Indeed, the Common sunbird-asity was placed with the sunbirds for 75 years until the anatomy of its syrinx was studied in more detail. The similarities also suggest that the false sunbirds evolved on Madagascar in the virtual absence of competitors that exploited flowers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the differences between the asities, all species share an enclosed, suspended, untidy nest with a side-entrance, a feature held in common with their closest relatives, the broadbills, but also with the true sunbirds. Interestingly, DNA studies suggest that the asities' nearest relative among the broadbills is the African green broadbill.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Asities occur alone or in pairs, except for the polygynous Velvet asity, in which the males hold adjacent small territories to attract females for copulation; in this species, only females build the nest and care for the eggs and chicks. Such breeding biology is common to several families of forest frugivores that live in the understory, including manakins. Males of Schlegel's asity may also call in close proximity, but in this species the males help at least with nest-building. The breeding biology of the sunbird-asities is virtually unknown.
