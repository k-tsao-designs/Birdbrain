		<h1>Drongo</h1>
		<p>
			Drongos are a distinctive family of medium-sized black birds that often perch in the open and offer a distinctive silhouette with their stout, hooked bill, long rictal bristles, short legs, and long, often distinctively-shaped tail. All are placed in the genus Dicrurus, except for the Papuan mountain drongo of New Guinea with its square tail of 12 (not 10) feathers and exceptionally long rictal bristles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Drongos appear to be most closely related to orioles, crows, bulbuls, birds of paradise, flycatchers, and shrikes.
		</p>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Drongos usually occur in pairs or, after breeding, in families accompanied by gray-barred juveniles with undeveloped tails and crests. They often sally forth from a perch, with spectacular swoops, curves, and twists, in pursuit of some passing insect. They are characterized by their long, forked, often lyre-shaped tail, the exact shape and structure of which varies from almost square to deeply forked. In a few species, the outer feathers are elongated, curled, or denuded of barbs to end in spoon-shaped rackets, as in the Greater and Lesser racket-tailed drongos of India and Southeast Asia. Other Asiatic species also have conspicuous crests, but the seven species of drongo that occur in Africa and the adjacent islands of the Indian Ocean are more conventional in appearance; their most extreme development is a deeply forked tail or brown wings.
		</p>
		<p>
The Fork-tailed drongo of sub-Saharan Africa and the Black drongo or “King crow” of the Indo-Malaysian region are so similar in appearance and biology that they are sometimes considered to be a single species. Both are abundant and familiar birds in a range of habitats, from gardens and fields to open woodland. Both accompany grazing animals in order to snatch up insects disturbed by their movements, sometimes even riding on their backs. This association is most prevalent during the dry season, when food is in short supply, and it is then that fruit and nectar are also most frequent in the diet. The Black drongo is even considered important to agriculture for the quantities of insect pests that it consumes around livestock, especially during winter when it congregates and roosts in flocks.
		</p>
		<p>
Both species are bold and pugnacious and will pirate food from other birds and small mammals, retrieving the prey in their bill from mid-air or the ground, and then flying back to a perch, where they hold the food underfoot and tear it to pieces with the bill like a small hawk. Both species are also excellent mimics, and the Fork-tailed Drongo will even utter the alarm call of other animals to scare them off and steal their food. Both species display their agile flight to best advantage at a grass fire, hunting the escaping insects, or at an emergence of winged termites, flying vertically upward to catch the ascending alates.
		</p>
		<p>
Other drongo species are all similar in their biology, where known, although some larger species, such as the Crow-billed drongo and the Spangled drongo, add more small vertebrates, such as lizards, birds, and bats, to their diet. Many other species also use animals as beaters, including monkeys, squirrels, and mixed-species bird parties, particularly in forest habitats. All species drink water when available, scooping it up in their bill or maybe sipping it as they plunge-bathe in pools, but only the Crow-billed drongo has been reported to wet its plumage on rain-soaked bark and twigs.
		</p>
		<p>
Each drongo species has a characteristic distribution of gloss on the feathers, from over the entire plumage to isolated spots on each feather, as in the Spangled drongo. Several Asian species such as the Hair-crested, Ribbon-tailed, and racket-tailed drongos have elaborate crests and tail feathers; these delicate structures may have an attraction for the opposite sex. The Hair-crested drongo also feeds more on nectar than any other species, however, so the crest may have an additional role in pollination. The development of these structures varies geographically within species, as does the extent of gray, white, or gloss in the plumage, for example in the Ashy or White-bellied drongos, suggesting that there are complex local selection pressures in operation.
		</p>
			
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Black and Fork-tailed drongos sing complex songs, including mimicked phrases that, in the Fork-tailed drongo, are incorporated by a pair into complex duets that may form part of their courtship melody. Later, both sexes take part in nest construction, incubation, and care of the young. A nesting pair of drongos will attack with great ferocity any crow or raptor that crosses its territory, often while mimicking the call of the intruder. Despite these defenses, the Fork-tailed drongo is the principal host to the African cuckoo, while the Black drongo is parasitized by the drongo-cuckoo and Common koel.
