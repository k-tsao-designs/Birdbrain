		<h1>Antbirds</h1>
		<p>
			Antbirds owe their name to the habit of some species of following swarming army ants. Although the birds do not feed on the ants themselves (the levels of formic acid in the insects would likely be toxic for birds of their size), they do prey extensively on the invertebrates that are flushed from cover by the swarms.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The antbirds have long been thought to be closely related to the gnateaters (Conopophagidae) and tapaculos (Rhinocryptidae), and recent research in fact suggests that the two Pittasoma antpittas are more closely related to gnateaters than other antpittas. More distant relatives include the ovenbirds (Furnaridae) and woodcreepers (Dendrocolaptidae); together with the other four families, these constitute the “suboscine tracheophone” branch of the Order Passeriformes, an anatomical division based primarily on the number and arrangement of the muscles in the syrinx. Some modern taxonomic treatments of this group place the Furnariidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Formicariidae, Conopophagidae, and Rhinocryptidae in Parv-order Furnariida, and the typical antbirds alone in Parvorder Thamnophilida.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most typical antbird species are relatively unmusical, producing harsh, churring alarm or contact calls. However, a few thamnophilid species such as the Spot-backed antshrike do have attractive songs and melodious calls. Ground antbirds also have simple vocalizations, but they are usually loud and far-carrying. Given their cryptic color patterns and loud voices, these birds are more often heard than seen.
		</p>

		<h2>Social Behavior</h2>
		<p>
			Typical antbirds form the core species for Neo-tropical mixed-species foraging flocks. Although many bird-watchers will be accustomed to seeing mixed flocks of birds moving through woodlands in Europe (where they might typically include tits, kinglets, nuthatches, creepers, and finches) or in North America (migrating warblers, chickadees, woodpeckers), it is in the lowland tropical forests, whose dense canopies can reach 60–80m (200–260ft), that this activity reaches a peak
		</p>
		<p>
			The function of such flocks is not fully understood, but the various explanations proposed fall into two main categories: firstly, that flock behavior enhances feeding efficiency by having many birds rather than single individuals searching for food, and secondly that group cohesion helps to reduce the risk of predation, with flock members giving early warning of the presence of predators to individuals that might otherwise be unaware of the danger. In either case, an individual bird would increase its survival rate by associating with a flock. Whatever the rationale, mixed flocks of insectivorous and omnivorous species work through the forest at about 0.3km/hr (0.2mph), occupying feeding levels from the ground to close to the canopy. The path followed may be very erratic and frequently crosses itself, depending on food availability.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is usually one bird or species that maintains the cohesion and impetus of the flock. In Central America this is often a parulid warbler such as the Three-striped warbler (Basileuterus tristriatus), but in South America it is more frequently an antbird (for instance, the Bluish-slate antshrike). As these core birds move through changing forest habitats, calling frequently, other birds are attracted to the flock for the time that it remains within their home range. As a result, there may be only one pair of each highly territorial species (perhaps together with its fledged young) in the flock at any one time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Birds do not always follow a flock that moves outside of their territory. Certain antbird species are more likely to join a mixed-species flock if a trespassing member of their own species is present, in which case they may do so in order to defend their home territory; participation rates also increase if the flock moves through their home range during the peak feeding and activity periods, early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Antbirds are generally less likely to associate with a mixed-species flock in the middle of the day or during inclement weather.
		</p>

		<h2>Antbirds and Army-Ant Swarms</h2>
		<p>
			Ants of the subfamily Dorylinae, such as Eciton burchelli, are well-known for their frequent swarming through tropical forests, either to move their colony or in sorties for feeding. A variety of birds take advantage of their activities to feed on invertebrates and small vertebrates that are disturbed by the passage of the columns. The main bird families involved are the cuckoos, woodcreepers, typical antbirds, and tanagers.
		</p>
		<p>
			About 50 typical antbird species – the so-called “professional” ant-followers – are regular attendants on ant swarms, but many other species will occasionally join in. Large colonies of regularly nomadic ants can attract up to 25 birds of one or two species at a time, plus scattered individuals of up to 30 other species. The professional ant-followers may obtain up to 50 percent of their food from antswarms, keeping a regular eye on the colonies to take advantage the moment the swarm starts to move.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is often a strict hierarchy in the attendant birds, with larger species such as the Ocellated antbird holding a central “territory” just ahead of the column, while smaller species like the Bicolored antbird hold peripheral territories. Some small species, such as the White-plumed antbird, utilize the whole area by making raids from the periphery, although only at the expense of being frequently attacked. Large and potentially dominant ground antbirds, such as Black-crowned antpittas, actually occupy peripheral zones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Territories exist vertically as well as horizontally, and many of the “non-professional” ant-followers feed in the outer or upper reaches, or even between the territories of the professionals. Many of the less regular members drop out as the ant-swarm moves out of their territory. In contrast, the professionals are prepared to share the resource to some extent, although individuals of a species only remain dominant over others of their own species while they are in their own territory.
