		<h1>Auk</h1>
		<p>
			Related to gulls, terns, and shorebirds, the auks are familiar seabirds that are often considered the northern hemisphere equivalents of the penguins, being well adapted to underwater swimming. The flightless Great auk became extinct in the 19th century, and all extant auk species retain the power of flight.
		</p>
		<p>
			Auks are among the most abundant seabirds on earth, with many populations numbering in the millions; for example, Common and Thick-billed murres, Least and Crested auklets, and dovekies all have world populations of more than 10 million individuals. They are the dominant seabirds over large areas of arctic and subarctic waters, and they may be significant predators on large zooplankton and small fishes in areas around their breeding colonies. They are compact, robust birds that swim underwater, using their wings as paddles. They include some of the bird world's deepest divers and, for their size, they have exceptional underwater speed and endurance.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Auks are small to medium-sized birds with short tails and small wings. In fact the size of their wings is a compromise, large enough for flying but small enough to use in the denser medium of water – hence their rapid wingbeats and whirring flight.
		</p>
		<p>
			The legs of most auks are positioned toward the rear of the body, which accounts for the upright posture of many species. Others, especially the murrelets, tend to lie on their belly while on the ground and rarely stand. The legs of some species are compressed laterally, an adaptation for swimming. The three toes are connected by webs. In species such as the Atlantic puffin and Black guillemot the legs and feet are bright orange or red, while in murrelets and Cassin's auklet they are blue. The mouth is also brightly colored in some species: red in the Black guillemot, yellow in the razorbill.
		</p>
		<p>
			The shape of the bill varies markedly, partly reflecting differences in diet and feeding methods. Species that feed mainly on plankton tend to have wider, shorter bills, while those of fish-eaters are longer and more daggerlike. Inside the mouth, the palette and tongue of plankton-feeders are covered with horny tubercles, which presumably assist in manipulating the prey. The Parakeet auklet, which feeds on jellyfish as well as crustacea, has a peculiar, scooplike bill, different from anything seen among other seabirds. In the razorbill and the puffins, the bill is laterally compressed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The large, colorful bills of the three puffins play an important role in pair formation and courtship. The bill is encased in nine distinct plates that are shed each year during the molt. Outside the breeding season, the puffin's bill is much reduced in size and is less brightly colored. The Rhinoceros auklet, closely related to the puffins, is unique in having a solid, fleshy “horn” projecting about 2cm (0.8in) above the base of the bill. This is not shed in winter and is found even in juvenile birds. Its function is unknown.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many auks have distinct summer and winter plumages. The Black and Pigeon guillemots are black with a white wing patch in the summer, but during the winter they are mainly white and gray. The Marbled and Kittlitz's murrelet have cryptic brown summer plumage, but outside the breeding season are mainly black above and white below. In the Crested and Whiskered auklets and the Tufted puffin, long head plumes and “whiskers” are lost during the winter, while species that have black throats in summer change them to white in winter. Only the Rhinoceros and Cassin's auklet and Craveri's and Xantus' murrelet look similar throughout the year.
