		<h1>Bunting (New World Sparrow)</h1>
		<p>
			The term “bunting” is derived from an old English word “buntyle,” the original meaning of which is somewhat obscure. Whatever its significance, the name was given to several seed- and insect-eating, ground-feeding birds that were resident in western Europe.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name was later carried by early settlers from Britain to other parts of the world and applied there to some not particularly closely related birds; in North America, for example, it served to designate some members of the cardinal grosbeaks (family Cardinalidae) such as the Indigo bunting. Confusingly, most true buntings of the New World are called sparrows, although they bear little relation to the familiar English birds, such as the House sparrow (Passer domesticus), also known by that name.
		</p>
	
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			The true buntings almost certainly evolved in the New World. About 85 percent of the world's species are found in the Americas, where they occupy a diverse and broad range of habitats. Among the 60 or so American species found north of Mexico, for example, there are birds that inhabit arctic tundra, boreal forest, prairies and meadows, deserts, alpine meadows, salt and freshwater marshes, and deciduous and coniferous woods. The ancestor of the Old World buntings probably crossed the Bering Sea into Asia, with the genus Emberiza evolving in temperate Asia, where it is best represented, and spreading westward into Europe and Africa. Interestingly, there are only a couple of buntings, the Crested and the Slaty, breeding in tropical Asia, and the group has failed to penetrate or persist in the East Indies–Australasia region, although the Cirl bunting and the yellowhammer have been introduced with some success into New Zealand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Buntings are characterized by a stout, conical bill adapted for crushing and taking the husks off seeds. The upper and lower parts of the bill can be moved sideways in some species. Juncos, for example, are particularly adept at manipulating, cracking, and discarding husks with their bills. Sparrows and buntings usually forage on the ground. Some, such as the towhees, scratch for food with a very distinctive “double scratch,” in which the bird remains stationary while scratching backward simultaneously with both feet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Buntings and New World sparrows show considerable diversity in plumage and voice; somberly plumaged species such as the Corn bunting, which is a dull grayish-brown with heavy streaks, contrast with the more brightly-plumed birds, such as the yellowhammer, with its bright yellow underparts and streaked yellow head, or the Lapland longspur, with its black, chestnut and white head markings. Except in those species in which the male has a bright display plumage, the sexes are alike in coloration.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			In temperate and arctic regions, most buntings are monogamous. In a majority of the species studied, including, for example, the Reed bunting, few males attract more than one female. Extra-pair paternity is common, however, and up to about 70 percent of broods contain extra-pair offspring. Reed buntings generally nest in marshes, often in high density, which makes mate-guarding hard. A small proportion of males are bigamous.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Eurasian Corn bunting is often polygamous, with some males within a population reportedly attracting up to three females at a time and others none at all. It is generally supposed that this mating system evolves when there are large differences in the quality of territory among males, so that a female is better off pairing with an already mated male in a good territory than with a bachelor male in a poor one.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Lark bunting of North America is also occasionally polygamous, probably especially where the birds occur in high densities. A male with an apparently high-quality territory is more likely to attract a second mate than one with a lower-quality territory. Lark buntings nest in dry, open fields with sparse vegetation, so a well-shaded site in which to build the nest is important to a female, and a territory that contains such a site may be selected even if there is another female already nesting there. Occasionally, more than one male Lark bunting will help at a nest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Smith's longspurs, which breed in subarctic tundra bordering on the northern edge of the treeline, form no pair bonds. When females are ready to lay their eggs, they mate repeatedly (up to 350 times in a week) with two or three males. The males, in turn, mate with more than one female. Studies confirm that, within broods, more than one male fathers the young, and two or more males may assist the female in raising them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reproductive behavior of the Saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow of the east coast of North America appears to be similar to that of Smith's longspur. Males do not defend a territory, although they may guard a female by chasing away other males; no pair bond is formed, and males do not assist in feeding the young.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most sparrows and buntings are territorial. In migratory species, the male characteristically arrives on the territory before the female and defends it against other males. Often, the male reoccupies the territory he held the year before. Less commonly, females return to the same territory in which they nested the previous year. Most breeding activities – courting, pairing, nesting, and raising young – occur within the territory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Collecting food for young may or may not occur within territory boundaries. For example, American tree sparrows defend large territories, usually of more than 1ha (2.5 acres), within which food is collected, whereas Clay-colored sparrows defend small territories of less than 1,000 sq m (11,000 sq ft) and forage exclusively outside the territory, often on communal feeding grounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The territories of the Eurasian yellowhammer tend to be linear, extending along a hedgerow of the edge of a wood; they are about 60m (200ft) long, and the defended area may extend 10–15m (33–50ft) into the adjacent field. The yellowhammer's territory is important for pair-formation and nesting, but foraging largely takes place in neutral ground beyond the territorial borders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even within species, the size of a territory varies both geographically and in different habitats. For example, song sparrows like the American tree sparrow defend a territory on which they feed. In Ohio, where the birds live in shrubby thickets in residential areas, in abandoned fields, and other brushy habitats, breeding territories average about 1ha (2.5 acres), whereas in the San Francisco Bay area, where they breed in saltmarshes along creeks that are flooded at high tide, their territories are about 0.4ha (1 acre) in extent. In Ohio, many individuals do not migrate south in winter, and these birds defend winter territories that are six to ten times larger than the breeding territories. Once the breeding season is over, territorial boundaries of migratory individuals break down and adults and young gather together in flocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of the breeding season, most migratory buntings and American sparrows form flocks that are essentially feeding aggregations. These flocks often contain individuals of several different species. Wintering flocks of sparrows are commonly rather small and loose, but in some species, especially the longspurs, Lark buntings, and Snow buntings, flocks of from a few dozen to thousands of individuals can occur. Longspurs characteristically flush from the shortgrass habitat in which they winter as a group and circle the area, often to return to near the place from which they flushed. When on the ground, even in sparse habitats, wintering longspurs are difficult to see.
		</p>
		<p>
			Courtship in buntings usually involves a male advertising his presence by singing, often from a conspicuous perch. When a female approaches, the male may chase her. During these courtship chases the male may buffet the female, and both birds may tumble to the ground. Song flights occur in open-country species. Males of Lapland longspurs and Snow buntings in the Arctic, and Chestnut-collared longspurs and Lark buntings on the North American prairies, for example, typically rise a few meters above the ground and then slowly circle back to earth, holding their slowly-beating wings at an angle above the body as they utter their song. The flight song of Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow of the American prairies is particularly spectacular. The male rises as much as 20m (65ft) up while uttering “tic” notes. He then sings as he glides forward and downward, sings for a second time, then drops into the vegetation perhaps 100m (330ft) from where he first took off.
		</p>
		<p>
			The songs of many buntings are among the more melodious of all bird songs; that of the Bachman's sparrow, for example, consists of a long, sweet note followed by a clear trill that carries a long distance. Other species, however, are less impressive. The song of the Corn bunting reminds one of jingling keys, while that of the Grasshopper sparrow is a high, thin, insectlike “chip chip scheeeeeee, tzick tzick.” Henslow's sparrow has one of the least impressive songs of all, an unobtrusive, short, insectlike “tsi-lick.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Nests are usually placed on the ground or low in a bush, and tend to be neat, compact cups built of dried vegetation (typically grass and weeds) and lined with hair, mosses, fine vegetation fibers, wool, and/or feathers. Females are usually solely responsible for building the nest, incubating the eggs, and brooding the young; males, however, contribute substantially to feeding the young, at both the nestling and the fledgling stages.
		</p>
		<p>
			In parts of their range where the seasons is long enough to permit more than one brood to be produced, male Savannah sparrows attend the fledged young of the first brood while their mate incubates a second set of eggs. When those eggs hatch, the male helps the female feed those young as well. On occasion, the male may be mated to two different females at the same time. Both within and among species, clutch sizes tend to be largest at high latitudes.
