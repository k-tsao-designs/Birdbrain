		<h1>Avocets and Stilts</h1>
		<p>
			The most striking physical feature of the avocets and stilts is the proportions of their bills and legs. The long, slender bills may either be straight or curved upward. Their legs, too, are long, and in the case of stilts extremely long. Avocets and stilts are thus adapted for feeding in deep water, and the three species of stilts usually feed in slightly deeper water than the avocets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stilts have characteristic black bills and bright pink legs and feet, while avocets have black bills and blue-gray legs and feet. The closely-related ibisbill, which is sometimes classified in its own family, has a distinctive long, crimson, decurved bill and greyish-purple legs.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Avocets and stilts fly with quick wingbeats, and their legs trailing behind. The front toes are well webbed in avocets and in the South Australian Banded stilt, but only partly in other species. Variation in the amount of webbing is related to the importance of swimming habits in each species. The ibisbill is found breeding in shingle-bed river valleys between 500 and 4,400m (1,640– 14,450ft) above sea level in parts of Asia, while the Andean avocet is restricted to lakes and marshes above 3,600m (11,800ft) in the Andes. The six other species are found in a variety of lowland wetlands that include freshwater marshes, brackish and coastal salt marshes, and coastal and inland salt lakes. The Black-winged stilt is the most widespread, with five subspecies found over six continents. Some populations of the most widespread species migrate over considerable distances; up to 30,000 Eurasian avocets have been counted wintering in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa.
		</p>
		<p>
			All species take a wide range of aquatic invertebrates and small vertebrates in relatively deep water. Important prey include mollusks, crustaceans including brine shrimps, insect larvae, annelid worms, tadpoles, and small fish. Stilts seize their prey from above or below the water surface with their long, needlelike beaks. Avocets either seize their prey directly in the water or with a scything motion of the bill. In this last method, the curved part of the submerged bill locates the prey by touch as it moves from side to side in the water or soft mud. Ibisbills wade breast-deep in mountain rivers and can probe for prey under stones and boulders.
		</p>
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Avocets appear to prefer nesting on islands, where predation may be reduced. In all species incubation is undertaken by both sexes. Most birds first breed when they are two years old. The Banded stilt is highly colonial: colonies of up to 27,000 pairs have been recorded, with the nests only about 2m (6.6ft) apart. Stilts usually nest in loose colonies of 20–40 pairs; in American avocets colonies range between 15–20 pairs, and Eurasian avocet colonies range between 20–70 pairs. Ibisbills defend linear territories of about 1km (0.6mi) along rivers. All species seem highly territorial, have fairly aggressive displays, defend nesting territories, and noisily mob intruders and potential predators. The young leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching, and the brood-rearing areas, which may change during the one-month fledging period, may be vigorously defended by the adults.
		</p>
		<h2>The Fall and Rise of Avocets in Britain</h2>
		<p>
			Avocets bred regularly in eastern England until the early 19th century, when they were wiped out by wetland reclamation followed by persistent egg collecting and shooting. Subsequently there was no regular breeding for over 100 years, until in 1947 Havergate Island and Minsmere in Suffolk were colonized. During the Second World War, the cattle-grazed fields of the Minsmere level had been deliberately flooded as a defensive measure, and, as a result of damage to a main sluice caused by a stray shell from a nearby firing range, the pastures on Havergate also became inundated.
		</p>
		<p>
			Breeding numbers on Havergate Island steadily increased to almost 100 pairs over the next 10 years, with an average at 1.5 chicks successfully fledging for each pair of breeding adults. However, this success coincided with a steady increase in the numbers of Black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) breeding in the same area, to about 6,000 pairs. There was intense competition for nest sites; gulls took over avocet nests within hours of their completion, and also killed newly-hatched avocets as they were being led through the densely packed gulleries. In the eight years after 1957, the fledging success of avocets dropped to about 0.5 per breeding pair, and breeding numbers fell to just 48 pairs.
		</p>
		<p>
			By 1965, however, constant removal of the gulls' nests and eggs by conservationists caused the larger birds' breeding numbers to drop to 1,000–1,500 pairs – a level at which they have since been maintained. The effect on avocets was marked. Over the next five years, from 1965 to 1969, their breeding population recovered, reaching 118 pairs in 1969, and fledged chicks averaged 1.7 per pair.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the 1970s avocets have increased in numbers and expanded their breeding range to the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Kent. In 1996 the breeding population was estimated at 592 pairs. A similar increase has also occurred in the Netherlands, due to increased food supplies in the Wadden Zee and the creation of new breeding sites. Some of these Dutch birds have probably immigrated to Britain.
