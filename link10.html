		<h1>Barn Owls and Bay Owls</h1>
		<p>
			The barn and bay owls are distinguished from the typical owls (family Strigidae) by several physical characteristics: they have heart-shaped, rather than round, faces; their middle and inner toes are of equal length (the inner is shorter in strigids); their middle claws are serrated; and their wishbones are fused to the breastbone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barn owls rely primarily on their extremely acute hearing, rather than their vision, to locate prey. Laboratory experiments in conditions of total darkness have demonstrated conclusively that the owls responded to sounds made by mice as they moved in leaf litter.
		</p>

		<h2>Social Behavior</h2>
		<p>
			The Barn owl's nocturnal lifestyle, ghostly white appearance, and association with ruins or churches (where it likes to nest) have earned it a place in the folklore of many cultures. However, as its English name implies, it is most commonly associated with agriculture. Wherever crops of grain are grown and stored, there are inevitably large populations of rats and mice, which attract Barn owls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barn owls will readily use artificial nesting boxes that have been specially provided for them, but are also opportunistic in their choice of nest site. For example, in the United States, they often nest in boxes that have been placed near water for the use of Wood ducks (Aix sponsa). In the Netherlands, farmers actively encourage owls by installing special “owl doors” to allow them easy access to their buildings, and by providing food in hard weather, which otherwise causes heavy losses. Unfortunately, the Barn owl's close association with agriculture was almost its undoing in Western Europe, since they suffered far more from poisoning by pesticides and herbicides than other owls. In Malaysia, Barn owls and chemicals are actually used together to control the plagues of rats that cause severe damage in oil-palm plantations. Formerly rare, Barn owls invaded the plantations after nesting boxes were erected for them to breed in. The owls can raise several families per year and often congregate in flocks of up to 40 birds. Each owl family eats about 1,300 rats per year, which can slow the recovery of rodent populations that have first been reduced by poisoning.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not every pest-control scheme involving Barn owls has been a success. In the 1950s they were introduced to the Seychelles, again to control rats. Unfortunately, the owls found the native birds easier to catch and in 12 years they eliminated the White tern (Gygis alba) from two islands.
		</p>
		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			The rodent-hunting Barn owl of open country is one of the most widely distributed of all birds, being found on every inhabited continent and many remote islands. The other thirteen barn owls occur in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australasia, as well as on islands in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean. They reach their greatest diversity in Australia, which is home to five species. The little-known Common bay owl is found in Asian forests from India to Java and Borneo.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Itombwe owl is known only from a single specimen collected in the Rift (or Itombwe) Mountains in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1951 and a bird that was caught and released in the same region in 1996. Based on the appearance of the museum specimen and photographs of the 1996 bird, it is probable that the Itombwe owl will eventually be found to be related to the barn owls rather than to the Common bay owl. The extremely limited range of this bird and continuing human encroachment on its habitat have led to it being classified as Endangered. The other endangered African barn owl, the Madagascar grass owl, which inhabits the northeast of the island, is under threat from deforestation for slash-and-burn agriculture.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two other threatened tytonid species, the Sula barn owl and the Minahasa masked owl, are from the Indonesian islands of Taliabu and Sulawesi, respectively. Here, they are imperiled by habitat loss and degradation as a result of extensive lowland rainforest clearance by commercial logging concerns. This threat is set to intensify as most remaining forest is under timber concession.
