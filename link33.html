		<h1>Fairy Wren</h1>
		<p>
			Aspecies of fairy-wren can be found in nearly every kind of habitat throughout the 40 degrees of latitude covered by Australia and New Guinea, ranging from dense, tall forest in well-watered southwest Australia (the Red-winged fairy-wren) to the spinifex-covered sand dunes of the interior desert (Eyrean grasswren). Characteristically, fairy-wrens have tails longer than their bodies, and these are carried cocked jauntily most of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The true fairy-wrens are diminutive birds that are endemic to Australia and New Guinea. Wherever they occur the ground cover is generally thick, and they hop rapidly through it on their long legs. Their wings are short and rounded, and they rarely make prolonged flights. Emu-wrens live deep in dense heathland: it is hard to catch more than a fleeting glimpse of them. Grasswrens are birds of the deserts, arid shrublands, and rocky plateaus, and they too are rarely seen.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Males of the genus Malurus are brightly colored in enameled reds, blues, blacks, and whites, while the females and immatures are usually brown. In the emu-wrens also there are clear differences between the sexes, but in the other three genera the sexes are hard to tell apart in the field.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the fairy-wrens depend largely on insects for food, but the grasswrens with their sturdier bills eat large quantities of seeds as well. Foraging is largely done as the birds bound along on the ground, although some species search through shrubs and even in the canopies of tall trees. Because their wings are small and rather inefficient, fairy-wrens only rarely fly sorties after airborne insects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout a wide variety of environments most species spend their lifetime within a prescribed area, which they defend from trespass by members of their species outside the immediate family; within it they find all their requirements for feeding, breeding, and shelter. Such “territories” cover from 1–3ha (2.5–7.4 acres), and tend to persist from year to year with little change.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Despite their small size the birds may live for a surprisingly long time (more than 10 years) compared with their counterparts in the northern hemisphere. A long life and residential status allows them to maintain family bonds beyond the usual period during which offspring depend on their parents for food and protection; most fairy-wrens tend to live in groups with more than two adults capable of breeding, yet only one female lays the eggs. Although the senior male in a group may fertilize some of his partner's eggs, a surprisingly large percentage are fathered by other males, often from outside the social group. Careful experimentation and radiotelemetry has shown that it is the female who chooses her partner, and that she seeks out her mate before sunrise during her fertile period.
		</p>
		<p>
			In most species of fairy-wren the female builds the nest, lays and incubates the eggs, and broods the young when they first hatch. Her partner may call her off the nest and escort her while she forages hurriedly before returning to brood. The young fledge after 10 days or so in the nest, and at first are unable to fly, although they will scuttle fast over the ground and hide. If a predator approaches a nest, all group members perform a frenzied “rodent run” display: instead of hopping, their usual mode of progression, they run, keeping close to the ground, trailing their tails, and squeaking – hence the name of the performance. This behavior is surprisingly effective in distracting a variety of predators, from snakes to humans.
		</p>
		<p>
			The young are fed for several weeks after they have left the nest. Fairy-wrens nest several times during a season, and the nonbreeding members of the group may take over the raising of an early brood to allow the breeding female to start a second (or third) nest. Later in the season, young hatched earlier will attend their nestling-siblings and help to raise them, so that the habit of “helping” appears early in life.
