		<h1>Albatross</h1>
		<p>
			Superstitious sailors once regarded the albatross as the repository of the souls of drowned comrades, and believed that to kill one was to court terrible misfortune. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts how disaster befalls a ship after an albatross is shot. Even so, many 19th-century sailors were happy to catch and eat these birds to vary their monotonous diet on long voyages, and to turn their feet into tobacco pouches and their wing bones into pipes. The name “albatross” comes from the Portuguese alcatraz, used originally for any large seabird and apparently derived from al-cadous, the Arabic term for pelican.

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Albatrosses are renowned for their effortless flight, as they follow ships for hours with barely a wing-beat. One adaptation to reduce the muscular energy expended during gliding is a special sheet of tendon that locks the extended wing in position. Another is the sheer length of the wing, in which the forearm bones are much longer in relation to the hand than in other procellariiforms. To it are attached 25–34 secondaries, as compared to just 10–12 in storm petrels. As a result, the wing is a very efficient aerofoil, the high aspect ratio (ratio of wing length to front-to-rear width) permitting fast forward gliding with a low sinking rate. Such adaptations for rapid, long-distance flight allow the albatrosses to traverse vast tracts of ocean from their breeding bases on oceanic islands.
		</p>

		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			From their habit of following ships, albatrosses are best known as scavengers of offal thrown overboard. They have broad diets, but detailed analysis of stomach contents shows that fish, squid, and crustaceans make up the overwhelming majority of their prey items. These are mostly seized at the surface, although the birds will occasionally plunge in the manner of gannets, and can reach surprising depths, for example 6m (20ft) in the case of the Grey-headed albatross and as much as 12m (almost 40ft) for the Light-mantled sooty albatross.
		</p>
		<p>
			Albatrosses sometimes feed during the hours of darkness, when many marine organisms come to the surface. Detailed information on the proportion of day and night feeding has been acquired by persuading birds to swallow a sensor that lodges in the stomach and records the sudden drop in temperature that occurs when the albatross swallows a fish snatched from the chilly Southern Ocean waters. The proportions of prey types differ between species, and these profoundly affect the breeding biology of the species.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Albatrosses are long-lived, with an average lifespan of 30 years, but they are slow breeders. Although they are physiologically capable of breeding at 3 or 4 years, in practice they do not usually start for several years after that time, and some may not breed until they are 15 years old. When they first mature, birds appear on the breeding grounds for only a short while towards the end of the breeding season, but in subsequent years they spend growing amounts of time ashore courting prospective mates. When a pair has been established, they usually remain together until one partner dies. “Divorce” occurs only after several breeding failures, and it can be costly, since it may be followed by a few years without breeding until a new pair is formed. Indeed a single divorce reduces the lifetime reproductive success of a Wandering albatross by as much as 10–20 percent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most albatrosses nest in colonies that sometimes number thousands of pairs with close-packed nests, although the two Phoebetria species nest more or less alone on cliff ledges. In several species the nest is a pile of soil and vegetation which may be so large that the adults can have difficulty in climbing onto it. The tropical albatrosses make a scanty nest, however, and the Waved albatross has no nest at all, shuffling about instead with its egg on its feet. Males arrive at the colonies first at the beginning of the breeding season, and mating occurs when the females come to join them.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some species, the parents alternate short trips of 1–3 days with longer excursions of 5 days or more to distant feeding grounds during the chick-rearing period. Wandering albatrosses exhibit a further refinement, in that males tend to search for food farther south and therefore in colder waters than females, exposing themselves to stormier conditions. It may be no accident, then, that the males of this species have a higher wing loading (weight:wing area ratio) than the females.
		</p>

		<h2>Wandering</h2>
		<p>
			Fledging takes from 120 days in Black-browed and Yellow-nosed albatrosses to 278 days in the Wandering albatross. The extremely long nesting period of the latter (356 days including incubation) means that it can attempt to breed only in alternate years since, after breeding, it must have a period of molt. In fact at least nine species are known to breed biennially, including all the “great” albatrosses, the two sooty albatrosses, and the Grey-headed albatross.
		</p>
		<p>
			While it once was thought that albatrosses wandered the oceans more or less aimlessly during their off-duty year, modern sensors attached to Wandering albatrosses have shown this not to be the case. Rather, it seems that individual birds head for a particular region of the ocean, and spend most of their time there.
