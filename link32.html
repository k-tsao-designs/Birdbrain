		<h1>Duck</h1>
		<p>
			For thousands of years, the waterfowl – swans, geese, and ducks – have provided humankind with eggs, meat, and feathers. People have hunted them, pursued them for sport, and domesticated them. Culturally, they have influenced art, music, dance, song, language, poetry, and prose. Their wetland habitat, on the other hand, has often had a bad press, being portrayed as dismal and dangerous and the source of such human ills as malaria. More recently, however, the need to conserve both waterfowl and the wetlands on which they depend has become increasingly obvious.
		</p>

		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Nearly all waterfowl nest on or beside fresh water, although several species such as brants, steamer ducks, and scoters live for much of the time in estuaries and on shallow seas. They are essentially aquatic birds, and so have a broad body flattened underneath, a medium to long neck, and shortish legs with webbed feet. The diving habit has evolved more than once within the group, and in diving birds the shape is particularly streamlined. The bill is usually rather broad and flattened, with a horny “nail” toward the tip that ends in some species with a slight hook. The sides of the man-dibles have comblike lamellae, which in some species strain food particles from the water, while the tongue is rather thick with short, spiny teeth along its edges, used for grasping and manipulating food items.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most ducks have their legs set well back on the body – some very far back – and so their progress on land can be slow and awkward. However, the many species that dive and feed underwater, such as pochards, scaup, seaducks, and stifftails, are able to move quickly and to maneuver well. A very few ducks, such as the Red-breasted merganser, also use their wings underwater, but generally the wings are held tight to the body when diving. Geese and sheldgeese are generally more terrestrial, especially when feeding – their longer legs are placed more centrally beneath the body, so they stand upright and can walk with ease.
		</p>
		<p>
			The waterfowl are divided here into fifteen tribes (plus the enigmatic Musk duck, which cannot for the moment be fitted into any tribe), based partly on internal features, such as the skeleton, external features, such as the type and pattern of plumage both of adults and of the downy (less than three-week-old) young, on behavior, and on recent analyses of DNA.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recent research on the Australian Musk duck has shown that it is not related to the stifftails with which is was at one time grouped. Any similarity is probably the result of convergence, largely of the hind limb, imposed by diving as a primary means of foraging. As in the Magpie goose, Musk duck young are fed by a parent. Male and female are very different in size (more so than in any other duck), and there is no pair bond; instead, the birds have a lek-type breeding system, by which 20 or more males display dramatically together in an arena and fertilize any female drawn within the circle. The males are pugnacious and belligerent toward one another, often chasing other males underwater.
		</p>
		<p>
The whistling ducks of the tribe Dendrocygnini have a wide distribution throughout the tropics and subtropics. Most are confined to rather small ranges, which do not overlap. The Fulvous whistling duck, however, has a most extraordinary distribution, occurring in the Americas, East Africa and Madagascar, and southern Asia; yet across all this enormous and discontinuous range there is no detectable variation of form.
		</p>
		<p>
Whistling ducks pair for life, and both parents care for the brood. They are mostly quite small, long-legged birds, with an upright stance. They get their name from their high-pitched whistling calls; an alternative name is “tree ducks,” from their fairly general habit of perching on branches. They have broad wings and are maneuverable rather than fast fliers. As well as walking well on land, they swim and occasionally dive.
		</p>
		<p>
The plumage is the same in both sexes, often highly patterned, particularly with brown, gray, and fawn. The flank feathers of the Fulvous duck and three other species are enlarged in showy ornaments, and the downy young have a distinctive plumage quite unlike that of any other waterfowl except the Coscoroba swan; the unique feature is a pale yellow or white line running right round the head under the eyes; the head is dark-capped. After copulation whistling duck pairs indulge in a mutual display, both sexes performing similar actions by raising the wing on the side nearest the mate.
		</p>
		<p>
The White-backed duck (tribe Thalassornithini) of Africa is clearly related to the whistling ducks, in that male and female look alike and share a long-term pair bond; both build the nest and incubate the eggs, and both care for the ducklings. However, White-backed ducks are highly adapted for diving, and this fact has altered their body shape entirely, so that, like the Musk duck, they resemble the stifftails in form (although without the stiffened tail feathers).
		</p>
		<p>
The Blue, Torrent, and steamer ducks may be only temporarily lumped together within the same tribe, the Merganettini; further research is needed. The steamer ducks are confined to southern South America, where they lead a predominantly aquatic life, often around the coasts. Three species have such short wings that they are completely flightless, while the fourth flies infrequently and weakly. All are very sturdily built, with short necks and legs and powerful bills. Steamer ducks get their name from their habit of using their legs and wings to thresh the water like a paddle-steamer's wheel in order to move more quickly when escaping from danger. Their plumage is predominantly gray, and the sexes are alike.
		</p>
		<p>
Blue and Torrent ducks live in white-water rapids in the southern hemisphere, taking aquatic invertebrates, such as caddisflies, that in the north would be eaten by salmonid fish. The birds are highly territorial, like the steamers, and pairs stay together throughout the year, both helping to rear the young. The Torrent duck, of which there are a number of well-marked geographic races, is adapted for living in the fast-flowing streams of the Andes in South America; it has a very streamlined shape, sharp claws for gripping slippery boulders, and a long, stiff tail used for steering in the fast-rushing water. The Blue duck occupies a similar habitat in New Zealand.
		</p>
		<p>
			The surface-feeding or dabbling ducks (Anatini) are the largest tribe of waterfowl and contains many highly successful and adaptable species. The great majority are small, short-legged, aquatic birds, feeding on the surface of the water or up-ending to dabble just beneath it. Dabbling ducks occur throughout the world, including on remote oceanic islands, from where a number of non-migrating species including the Laysan duck and Auckland Island teal have been described. Many other dabbling ducks such as the Northern pintail, Green-winged teal, and Eurasian wigeon are highly migratory and fly long distances; the smaller species are also very maneuverable in the air, taking off almost vertically from the water. A few can perch on branches and other structures, an ability rare or absent in nearly all other waterfowl. About a third are hole-nesters, and the young of these have sharp claws on their feet and rather stiff tails, both used in climbing out of the holes soon after hatching. Many occur mainly in tropical and subtropical latitudes, extending into the temperate zone in a few cases including the Mandarin ducks. In smaller species such as the pygmy geese, the sexes are dissimilar and the birds show a wide variation in coloring, from dull brown to bright chestnut, green, and white.
		</p>
		<p>
			In many species the male is brightly colored, generally with an iridescent speculum in the wing, while the female and juveniles are a cryptic brown. However, males lose their bright colors after breeding, and they also are brown while flightless during the wing molt. Brown, green, chestnut, white, and pale blue all occur frequently. Displays involve complex movements by the male that show off his plumage to best advantage. Females are much less demonstrative, and mutual display movements are absent or rare. The female usually cares for the ducklings alone, although the drake of a few tropical species does help guard his offspring against predation.
		</p>

		<h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
		<p>
			None of the vegetarian waterfowl have bacteria in the gut to help them digest cellulose. The nutrients they obtain from plant leaves and stems are restricted to the cell juices, obtained by breaking down the cell walls in their gizzards with the aid of small particles of grit, which they ingest for the purpose. These species have to feed for long periods, often the majority of daylight hours in temperate winter latitudes, in order to obtain sufficient food. The plant remains pass through the gut in recognizable form, and it is usually possible to identify the species of plant the birds have eaten from their droppings.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the grazers are known to select the most nutritious parts of the plant, such as the growing tips of grass leaves, dabbling ducks appear to be altogether less selective, taking in relatively large quantities of surface water through the tips of their bills and pumping it out of the sides through the comb-like lamellae with the aid of their tongues. The trapped particles, seeds, and insects are then swallowed at intervals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Diving ducks feed on underwater plants and invertebrates of all kinds, generally in fairly shallow water often only a few meters deep. The seaducks and sawbills may dive to considerable depths, the latter pursuing and catching fish and large, free-swimming invertebrates, while the former prize mollusks from rocks, or catch crabs and other crustaceans in shallow water or soft mud. Their bills are large and powerful, well adapted for grasping the shells of such prey, which are crushed after ingestion in their gizzards. Some of the shelducks also feed in a marine environment, sifting tiny mollusks and crustaceans from the mud of estuaries, while the steamer ducks, like the eiders, use their strong bills to prize mussels from tideline rocks. The stifftails also feed almost exclusively underwater. They swim along the bottom, sifting through the silt with their lower mandible just entering it, catching animal prey and in particular chironomid (midge) larvae.
		</p>

		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			Many ducks only select a mate for a single breeding season, although pairing may take place during the previous fall, as in the case of many dabbling ducks, through to the spring, as in many pochards and seaducks. The pair bond usually breaks as soon as the female has begun incubation. She generally rears the young until they can fly before deserting them, although some female pochards may abandon their young when they are only half grown. “Crèche care” of several broods by a few females takes place in some of the seaducks, and in some shelducks.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pair bond and parental care in stifftails are both very short-lived, and most young fend for themselves almost from the day of hatching. Such is the case with the Black-headed duck, which never makes a nest of its own, laying entirely in the nests of others, and whose offspring receive no parental care at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			The great majority of waterfowl are gregarious, some of them highly so.
