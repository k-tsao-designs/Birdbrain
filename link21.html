		<h1>Cranes</h1>
		<p>
			Cranes are birds of superlatives. not only are they one of the oldest groups of birds, dating back to the Paleocene, some 60 million years ago; they are also long-lived, with captive cranes surviving into their seventies and eighties. Moreover, they are the tallest flying birds; some species stand up to 1.8m (6ft) high.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cranes' beauty and grace are legendary, and have long been revered by many indigenous peoples. Unfortunately, they are also among the world's most endangered birds; 9 of the 15 species are now at risk, and humankind is entirely responsible for their recent decline.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2>Form and Function</h2>
		<p>
			Cranes have long, powerful, straight beaks, and all species have long necks and legs. They are heavy-set and have loud, shrill calls that carry for several kilometers; indeed, few calls in the bird world are louder. The windpipe of several species is lengthened by coiling within the breastbone: this extended organ amplifies the calls. Cranes fly with their necks extended forward. During flight the legs are usually stretched straight beyond the short, stubby tail, but in cold weather flying cranes fold their legs and tuck their feet under the breast feathers. Although they are predominantly aquatic birds, their feet are not webbed, and they are restricted to the shallows where they breed, search for food, and rest during the night.
		</p>

		<h2>Distribution Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Generally cranes are birds of the open marshlands, grasslands, and agricultural fields. Most species usually nest in secluded areas of shallow wetlands, the exceptions being the two species of Anthropoides, which often nest in grasslands or semidesert areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only the two Balearica species of crowned cranes roost in trees. The crowned cranes are also the “living fossils” of the family. In the remote Eocene (55–34 million years ago), these loose-plumed birds with enormous, gaudy crests flourished in the northern continents for millions of years before the Earth cooled and the cold-adapted cranes evolved. The Ice Ages restricted the range of the crowned cranes to the savannas of central Africa, where tropical conditions were maintained during the periods when northern continents were covered by ice. Two species of crowned cranes still grace the African grasslands, while 13 of the cold-adapted species now stalk the wetlands of the northern hemisphere and Australia.
		</p>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>
			Today's successful crane species are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders that have adapted within the last few thousand years to benefit from agricultural fields. Several Grus species, both crowned cranes, and both species of Anthropoides have short beaks with which they can effectively grasp insects, pluck ripe seeds from grass stems, and graze on fresh green vegetation in a gooselike manner. In contrast, most of the endangered species have long, powerful mandibles, used to dig for plant roots and tubers in muddy soils or for grasping aquatic animals such as small fish, amphibians, and crustaceans. Aquatic feeders include the larger cranes (Wattled, Sarus, Brolga, Whooping, Siberian, Red-crowned, and White-naped).
		</p>
		
		<h2>Breeding Biology</h2>
		<p>
			In the wild, most cranes do not start to breed until they are 3–5 years old. More successful species such as the Sandhill and Common cranes often rear two chicks per breeding attempt. In contrast, the rarer ones, including the Whooping and Siberian cranes, usually rear only one chick. In captivity too, they are often more difficult to breed than the successful species.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cranes are monogamous, and with the onset of spring or the rainy season mated pairs retreat to secluded grasslands or wetlands, where they establish and vigorously defend a breeding territory that may include several thousand hectares, depending on species or topography.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mated pairs emit a loud “unison call” duet, during which the male and female calls are distinct yet synchronized. In most species the male emits a series of long, low calls, for each of which the female produces several short, high-pitched calls. In most species this display identifies the sex of each of the birds. The unison call assists in the development of the pair bond and in the defense of the breeding territory. After a stable relationship has been established between two cranes, however, the unison call functions primarily as a threat. At dawn the crane pairs announce their territory with a unison call; neighboring pairs respond with more unison calls that carry for kilometers across the wetlands and grasslands.
		</p>
		<p>
			At a secluded spot within the wetland breeding territory, the pair build a platform nest. Crowned cranes often lay a three-egg clutch, while other cranes lay two eggs, with the exception of the Wattled crane, which more often lays a single egg.
		</p>
		<p>
			Male and female cranes share incubation duties. The female usually incubates during the night, while the male takes his turn during the day. The bird that is not on the nest usually feeds at a considerable distance from it, sometimes in a “neutral area” in company with other cranes. Incubation lasts 28–36 days, depending on the species and the parents' attentiveness at the nest. Crowned cranes do not initiate incubation until the clutch is complete, so that their eggs hatch simultaneously. Other cranes begin incubation as soon as the first egg is laid, and chicks generally hatch two days apart.
		</p>
		<p>
			Crane chicks are well-developed (precocial) when they hatch, and follow their parents around the shallows until they develop flight feathers at 2–4 months of age. The larger tropical species, such as the Wattled and Sarus cranes, have a longer pre-fledging period than species such as the Siberian crane, in which the short arctic summer limits the period when food is available for the fast-growing chicks. Although most eggs will usually hatch, many chicks die, and many of the species that are now considered endangered only rear a single chick per breeding effort. Once fledged, the chicks remain with their parents until the onset of the next breeding season. Migratory cranes learn the migration route by accompanying their parents south to traditional wintering grounds, in some species over distances of thousands of kilometers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nurture as well as nature is well demonstrated in cranes. Although they perform their complex visual and vocal displays instinctively, learning determines the context in which the display is performed; for example, young cranes reared by humans prefer to associate with humans rather than with cranes, and will solicit or threaten people. Young cranes are taught by their parents where and on what to feed.
		</p>

		<h2>Conservation and Environment</h2>
		<p>
			The aquatic feeders are among the most threatened cranes, with loss and degradation of wetlands a key factor in the birds' decline. In addition, their size and their plumage render them conspicuous and easy prey for hunters and egg collectors.
		</p>
		<p>
			In North America the Whooping crane – which has the distinction of being the rarest species – has recovered from about 20 birds in the early 1940s to about 400 (wild and captive) today. The Red-crowned crane is the next rarest, at about 1,800 birds in the wild. Siberian cranes number 2,500–3,000 individuals, White-naped and Black-necked each perhaps 5,000, Wattled 8,000, and Hooded 11,000. Fortunately, cranes are appealing birds, and recent efforts in many Asian countries have resulted in the protection of wetlands critical to their survival. But crane-hunting continues in countries such as Afghanistan and the Northwest Frontier province of Pakistan, where 2,000–4,000 live birds are captured each year, and the pressures on the wetlands increase as human numbers soar.
		</p>
		<p>
Asia has five endangered species, each numbering in the low thousands. Cranes have special symbolic value in many Asian cultures, and conservationists are optimistic that each of these species will avoid extinction, although in low numbers, with the possible exception of the highly wetland-dependent Siberian crane. Siberian cranes are adapted exclusively to excavating fleshy roots and tubers of aquatic plants from shallow water, and unlike other species are not able to forage in fields and grasslands during migration and on their wintering grounds. Saving wide expanses of shallow wetlands is a major challenge in China, where the vast majority of the Siberian cranes reside from October through April.
		</p>
		<p>
Although many cranes are endangered, they respond well to protection and management. In an effort to ensure their survival, captive flocks of the endangered species are now being soundly and cooperatively managed at zoos and specialized crane research centers. At the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland in the United States, a captive flock of Whooping cranes has been established by collecting one egg from each wild crane's nest containing two eggs. Now captive‐produced Whooping cranes are being used to start new wild populations in Florida and Wisconsin. Additional captive populations of Whooping cranes have been established at the International Crane Foundation in Wisconsin, at the Calgary Zoo in Canada, and at several zoos in the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
Between 1976 and 1988 captive‐produced Whooping crane eggs, and eggs collected from the wild cranes, were substituted into the nests of Sandhill cranes in ldaho. The foster‐parents reared many Whooping cranes, and 77 birds migrated south with the Sandhills to wintering grounds in New Mexico. Although Whooping cranes are more aquatic than Sandhills, the rare cranes learned to forage in the more upland niche of the Sandhills. In addition, they learned the migration route of their foster‐parents and repeated it each spring and autumn. Unfortunately, though, not a single conspecific pairing occurred. One male Whooping crane paired with a female Sandhill crane, and they produced one hybrid chick before the male disappeared.
		</p>
		<p>
Based on studies in cross‐fostering of captive cranes at the International Crane Foundation and throughout the experiment in Idaho, it became apparent that chicks sexually imprint on the foster‐parent species. Consequently, an ethologist, Dr. Robert Horwich, developed a remarkable method called “isolation rearing,” under which captive‐reared cranes never see or hear humans. They are exposed to mounted brood models, taped crane calls, hand puppets that resemble the head and neck of their species, adult conspecifics in adjacent enclosures, and crane‐costumed humans. The crane costume consists of a suitably colored cloak to hide the human form. A face screen allows the human to observe the cranes, but prevents the cranes from seeing human features. Horwich's initial research on Sandhills indicates that isolation‐reared cranes readily join wild cranes, migrate with them, and return to the natal area in spring.
		</p>
		<p>
In an effort to establish a non‐migratory population of Whooping cranes similar to a population that was extirpated from Louisiana in the 1940s, a release program has been under way in Florida since 1993. More than 200 Whooping cranes have been parent‐ and isolation‐reared at the various captive breeding centers and released into south‐central Florida. Many pairs formed, and in the year 2000 one pair hatched two chicks and reared one juvenile until it was almost fledged, when the young bird was unfortunately killed by a bobcat. Although bobcat predation has been the major mortality factor in Florida, the flock now numbers around 97 birds. It is hoped that when drought conditions in Florida end, many pairs of Whooping cranes will be able to breed, and establish a self‐sustaining, non‐migratory population.
		</p>
		<p>
Two techniques have been developed to teach captive‐reared cranes a new migration corridor. One technique involves releasing captive‐produced cranes with a flock of wild cranes prior to their migration. The released birds then learn the migration route of the wild cranes. The second technique involves teaching isolation‐reared captive cranes to follow an ultralight aircraft. By conditioning the cranes shortly after they hatch, fledging cranes can be trained to follow the aircraft, and the young cranes can then be led in a series of short flights to reach the desired wintering area. Weaned from the costumed keeper, crane‐costumed pilots, and the ultralight aircraft, the birds remain at the wintering site until the following spring. Then, without assistance from humans, they migrate back to the area where they were reared. Several migrations have been made with groups of Sandhill cranes, and one migration was made with a mixed flock of Whooping cranes and Sandhills. In the latest migration, which ended in November 2002, pilots guided 16 Whooping crane colts from Wisconsin to the central west coast of Florida, a journey that lasted 49 days and covered some 1,940 km (1,200 miles).
